Email escalation allows you to re-send function calls or human contacts with increased urgency when you haven't received a response within an acceptable timeframe. This is essential for time-sensitive operations that require human oversight.

## When to Use Email Escalation

- **Time-critical approvals**: When a function call approval is blocking critical business operations
- **No response received**: When the initial contact hasn't responded within your SLA
- **Different stakeholder needed**: When you need to involve higher-level decision makers
- **Channel change required**: When you need to send to a different email address for urgency

## Types of Email Escalation

### Basic Escalation

Add additional email recipients to the existing email channel while keeping the same contact method and subject line.

<CodeGroup>

```python example.py
hl.escalate_email_function_call(
    call_id=call.call_id,
    escalation=Escalation(
        escalation_msg="Please review - this approval is blocking deployment",
        additional_recipients=[
            EmailRecipient(
                address="manager@company.com",
                field="cc"
            )
        ]
    )
)
```

```typescript example.ts
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "Please review - this approval is blocking deployment",
  additional_recipients: [
    {
      address: "manager@company.com",
      field: "cc",
    },
  ],
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Channel-Based Escalation

Send the escalation to a completely different email address, with optional custom subject line and recipients.

<CodeGroup>

```python example.py
hl.escalate_email_function_call(
    call_id=call.call_id,
    escalation=Escalation(
        escalation_msg="URGENT: Production deployment blocked - need immediate approval",
        channel=ContactChannel(
            email=EmailContactChannel(
                address="ceo@company.com",
                experimental_subject_line="üö® URGENT: Production Approval Required",
                additional_recipients=[
                    EmailRecipient(address="cto@company.com", field="cc")
                ]
            )
        )
    )
)
```

```typescript example.ts
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg:
    "URGENT: Production deployment blocked - need immediate approval",
  channel: {
    email: {
      address: "ceo@company.com",
      experimental_subject_line: "üö® URGENT: Production Approval Required",
      additional_recipients: [{ address: "cto@company.com", field: "cc" }],
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Escalation Patterns

### Progressive Escalation

Start with adding recipients, then escalate to different email addresses:

<CodeGroup>

```python example.py
# First escalation: Add team members
hl.escalate_email_function_call(
    call_id=call.call_id,
    escalation=Escalation(
        escalation_msg="Needs review - please take a look",
        additional_recipients=[
            EmailRecipient(address="team-lead@company.com", field="to")
        ]
    )
)

# Wait for response...
time.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes

# Second escalation: Different email with urgency
hl.escalate_email_function_call(
    call_id=call.call_id,
    escalation=Escalation(
        escalation_msg="URGENT: Still no response - escalating to management",
        channel=ContactChannel(
            email=EmailContactChannel(
                address="director@company.com",
                experimental_subject_line="üö® URGENT: Approval Required"
            )
        )
    )
)
```

```typescript example.ts
// First escalation: Add team members
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "Needs review - please take a look",
  additional_recipients: [{ address: "team-lead@company.com", field: "to" }],
});

// Wait for response...
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300000)); // 5 minutes

// Second escalation: Different email with urgency
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "URGENT: Still no response - escalating to management",
  channel: {
    email: {
      address: "director@company.com",
      experimental_subject_line: "üö® URGENT: Approval Required",
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### No-Channel-to-Channel Escalation

Create function calls without email channels (using project defaults), then escalate with specific email addresses:

<CodeGroup>

```python example.py
# Create without specific email channel
call = hl.create_function_call(
    spec=FunctionCallSpec(
        fn="delete_production_data",
        kwargs={"table": "users"}
        # No channel - uses project defaults or CLI
    )
)

# Later escalate with specific high-priority email
hl.escalate_email_function_call(
    call_id=call.call_id,
    escalation=Escalation(
        escalation_msg="CRITICAL: Production data deletion requires executive approval",
        channel=ContactChannel(
            email=EmailContactChannel(
                address="ceo@company.com",
                experimental_subject_line="‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Production Data Deletion"
            )
        )
    )
)
```

```typescript example.ts
// Create without specific email channel
const call = await hl.createFunctionCall({
  spec: {
    fn: "delete_production_data",
    kwargs: { table: "users" },
    // No channel - uses project defaults or CLI
  },
});

// Later escalate with specific high-priority email
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg:
    "CRITICAL: Production data deletion requires executive approval",
  channel: {
    email: {
      address: "ceo@company.com",
      experimental_subject_line: "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Production Data Deletion",
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Methods

<CodeGroup>

```python example.py
# Function Call Email Escalation
hl.escalate_email_function_call(call_id=call_id, escalation=escalation)

# Human Contact Email Escalation
hl.escalate_email_human_contact(call_id=call_id, escalation=escalation)
```

```typescript example.ts
// Function Call Email Escalation
hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call_id, escalation);

// Human Contact Email Escalation
hl.escalateEmailHumanContact(call_id, escalation);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Escalation Object

```typescript
interface Escalation {
  escalation_msg: string; // Required: Reason for escalation
  additional_recipients?: EmailRecipient[]; // Optional: Extra email recipients
  channel?: ContactChannel; // Optional: New email channel override to escalate to
}
```

### Channel Priority and Recipient Handling

When both the original call and escalation have email channels:

1. **Escalation channel provided**: Uses the escalation email channel as the primary recipient
2. **No escalation channel**: Uses the original function call/contact email channel as primary
3. **Recipients merging**: The system combines recipients from multiple sources:
   - Original channel's `additional_recipients`
   - Escalation's `additional_recipients`
   - Escalation channel's `additional_recipients` (if channel override provided)
