Email escalation allows you to re-send function calls or human contacts with increased urgency when you haven't received a response within an acceptable timeframe. This is essential for time-sensitive operations that require human oversight.

## When to Use Email Escalation

- **Time-critical approvals**: When a function call approval is blocking critical business operations
- **No response received**: When the initial contact hasn't responded within your SLA
- **Different stakeholder needed**: When you need to involve higher-level decision makers
- **Channel change required**: When you need to send to a different email address for urgency

## Types of Email Escalation

### Basic Escalation

Add additional email recipients to the existing email channel while keeping the same contact method and subject line.

```typescript
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "Please review - this approval is blocking deployment",
  additional_recipients: [
    {
      address: "manager@company.com",
      field: "cc"
    }
  ]
});
```

### Channel-Based Escalation

Send the escalation to a completely different email address, with optional custom subject line and recipients.

```typescript
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "URGENT: Production deployment blocked - need immediate approval",
  channel: {
    email: {
      address: "ceo@company.com",
      experimental_subject_line: "üö® URGENT: Production Approval Required",
      additional_recipients: [
        { address: "cto@company.com", field: "cc" }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

## Escalation Patterns

### Progressive Escalation

Start with adding recipients, then escalate to different email addresses:

```typescript
// First escalation: Add team members
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "Needs review - please take a look",
  additional_recipients: [
    { address: "team-lead@company.com", field: "to" }
  ]
});

// Wait for response...
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300000)); // 5 minutes

// Second escalation: Different email with urgency
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "URGENT: Still no response - escalating to management",
  channel: {
    email: {
      address: "director@company.com", 
      experimental_subject_line: "üö® URGENT: Approval Required"
    }
  }
});
```

### No-Channel-to-Channel Escalation

Create function calls without email channels (using project defaults), then escalate with specific email addresses:

```typescript
// Create without specific email channel
const call = await hl.createFunctionCall({
  spec: {
    fn: "delete_production_data",
    kwargs: { table: "users" }
    // No channel - uses project defaults or CLI
  }
});

// Later escalate with specific high-priority email
await hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call.call_id, {
  escalation_msg: "CRITICAL: Production data deletion requires executive approval",
  channel: {
    email: {
      address: "ceo@company.com",
      experimental_subject_line: "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Production Data Deletion"
    }
  }
});
```

## API Methods

### Function Call Email Escalation

```python
# Python
hl.escalate_email_function_call(call_id, escalation)
```

```typescript
// TypeScript  
hl.escalateEmailFunctionCall(call_id, escalation)
```

### Human Contact Email Escalation

```python
# Python
hl.escalate_email_human_contact(call_id, escalation)
```

```typescript
// TypeScript
hl.escalateEmailHumanContact(call_id, escalation)
```

## Escalation Object

```typescript
interface Escalation {
  escalation_msg: string;                    // Required: Reason for escalation
  additional_recipients?: EmailRecipient[];  // Optional: Extra email recipients
  channel?: ContactChannel;                  // Optional: New email channel to escalate to
}
```

### Channel Priority

When both the original call and escalation have email channels:

1. **Escalation channel provided**: Uses the escalation email channel completely
2. **No escalation channel**: Uses the original function call/contact email channel  
3. **Recipients**: Merges escalation channel recipients + `additional_recipients`

## Best Practices

### Timing
- Don't escalate immediately - allow reasonable response time
- Use progressive escalation with increasing urgency
- Consider time zones and business hours

### Email Messaging
- Be specific about why escalation is needed
- Include context about business impact
- Use clear, professional language even when urgent

### Email Addresses
- Have a clear escalation hierarchy defined
- Use group emails for team escalations
- Reserve executive emails for truly critical issues

### Subject Lines
- Use emoji sparingly for genuine urgency (üö®, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Include business impact in subject
- Keep subjects concise but descriptive
