# Research: Understanding the Worktree Sync Bug Analysis

**Branch**: theme
**Repository**: humanlayer
## Research Question

The contents of `thoughts/allison/worktree_sync_bug_analysis.md` need to be better understood.

## Summary

The worktree sync bug is a critical issue where the thoughts auto-sync functionality catastrophically confused repository boundaries when run in a git worktree. After committing Gruvbox theme changes, an auto-sync commit attempted to replace the entire humanlayer codebase with the thoughts repository structure. This bug exposes fundamental limitations in how the thoughts system handles non-standard git configurations, particularly worktrees located outside the main repository directory.

## Detailed Findings

### The Bug Incident

The bug manifested after a successful commit (f2ca017) implementing Gruvbox themes in the `humanlayer-wui` component. An automatic "Auto-sync" commit (e23a395) was created that:

- Deleted the entire humanlayer codebase (all source files, examples, docs)
- Added the thoughts repository structure (global/, repos/, etc.) to the code repository
- Preserved only the changes made to humanlayer-wui
- Left the worktree in an unusable state requiring manual reset

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from multiple factors converging:

1. **Worktree Location**: The worktree at `~/.humanlayer/worktrees/humanlayer_theme/` is outside the main repository structure
2. **Repository Detection**: The sync uses `process.cwd()` without proper git worktree boundary detection (`hlyr/src/thoughtsConfig.ts:103-105`)
3. **Absolute Path Mapping**: The system maps repositories using absolute paths, treating worktrees as separate entities
4. **Symlink Confusion**: The thoughts directory contains symlinks to absolute paths that may have confused the sync logic

### Implementation Details

#### Auto-Sync Mechanism (`hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/sync.ts`)

- Stages all changes with `git add -A` (line 35-47)
- Creates commits with "Auto-sync with commit: [message]" format
- Runs automatically via post-commit hook (`hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/init.ts:186-201`)
- Executes in background to avoid blocking git operations

#### Repository Boundary Detection

- Current implementation simply returns `process.cwd()` as repository path
- No traversal to find actual repository root
- No special handling for git worktrees
- Each worktree requires separate initialization and mapping

#### Git Hook Issues

- Pre-commit hook prevents committing thoughts/ to code repo
- Post-commit hook triggers auto-sync
- Hooks assume `.git` is a directory, but in worktrees it's a file
- PR #241 addresses this specific issue using `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`

## Code References

- `hlyr/src/thoughtsConfig.ts:103-105` - getCurrentRepoPath() implementation
- `hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/sync.ts:35-47` - Auto-sync staging and commit logic
- `hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/init.ts:186-201` - Post-commit hook installation
- `hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/init.ts:166` - Hardcoded .git/hooks path assumption
- `hlyr/src/thoughtsConfig.ts:433` - Repository mapping storage

## Architecture Insights

1. **Push-Only Design**: The thoughts system only pushes changes, never pulls from remote
2. **Symlink-Based Structure**: Uses symlinks to centralize thoughts while appearing local
3. **Hook-Driven Automation**: Relies on git hooks for protection and auto-sync
4. **Absolute Path Dependencies**: System depends on absolute paths for mapping, causing worktree issues
5. **No Worktree Awareness**: Implementation lacks special handling for git's worktree feature

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)

- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-06-24_11-43-38_worktree_thoughts_init_bug.md` - Documents ENOTDIR error when initializing in worktrees
- `thoughts/global/allison/thoughts_tool_original.md` - Original design emphasizing separate git repos with symlinks
- `thoughts/shared/prs/235_description.md` - Searchable directory enhancement for AI tools that don't follow symlinks
- `hack/create_worktree.sh` - Team actively uses worktrees in `~/.humanlayer/worktrees/`

## Related Research

- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-06-24_11-43-38_worktree_thoughts_init_bug.md` - Related worktree initialization bug

## Open Questions

1. Should the sync functionality be disabled in worktrees until properly fixed?
2. How can repository boundary detection be improved to handle non-standard locations?
3. Should worktrees share the same thoughts mapping as their parent repository?
4. What safeguards can prevent sync from ever touching code files?
5. How can the system better handle cases where cwd is not the repository root?
