# Research: Inject Query as First Event Plan Review

**Date**: 2025-01-24 14:48:00
**Researcher**: allison
**Git Commit**: 1de077ec2e8b97ad5e039db98f85e6e43b84fe48
**Branch**: summary
**Repository**: humanlayer
## Research Question

Review the plan in `thoughts/allison/plans/inject-query-as-first-event.md` to ensure it's fully thought out, identify missing considerations, and verify it will be successful.

## Summary

The plan is well-structured and addresses the core requirements, but there are several critical issues and missing considerations that need to be addressed:

1. **Sequence numbering conflict** - The plan suggests using `sequence=0` for injected queries, but the current system starts sequences at 1
2. **Claude session ID timing** - The plan doesn't fully address the race condition between query injection and Claude session ID capture
3. **Migration complexity** - No formal migration system exists; the plan needs a more robust approach
4. **Event deduplication** - No consideration for preventing duplicate query events
5. **Continued session handling** - The plan doesn't account for how sequences work across parent/child sessions

## Detailed Findings

### Current Implementation Analysis

#### Query Storage (`hld/store/sqlite.go:71`, `hld/store/store.go:49`)

- Queries are stored in the `sessions` table as `query TEXT NOT NULL`
- Full queries are preserved but truncated for display (50 chars in Web UI, 39 in TUI)
- No existing `summary` field in the database schema

#### Conversation Event System (`hld/store/store.go:82-125`)

- Events have types: `message`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `system`
- Sequence numbers are scoped to `claude_session_id`, not `session_id`
- Sequences start at 1 and increment from MAX(sequence) for each Claude session
- Transaction-based sequence assignment prevents race conditions

#### Session Continuation (`hld/session/manager.go:616-812`)

- Parent and child sessions have different `session_id` values
- Each resumed session gets a NEW `claude_session_id` from Claude
- This creates natural sequence "resets" between parent and child sessions

### Critical Issues with the Plan

#### 1. **Sequence Number Conflict**

The plan proposes using `sequence=0` for injected queries, but:

- Current implementation in `AddConversationEvent` (`hld/store/sqlite.go:474-522`) uses `MAX(sequence) + 1`
- If no events exist, this results in `NULL + 1 = 1`, not 0
- Need to either:
  - Modify the sequence logic to handle 0 as a special case
  - Use sequence=1 and ensure it's added before any Claude events

#### 2. **Claude Session ID Race Condition**

The plan mentions "handle the case where Claude session ID isn't known yet" but doesn't provide a solution:

- Query injection happens immediately after session creation
- Claude session ID is only captured when the first stream event arrives
- The injected event needs `claude_session_id` for proper sequencing
- Solutions:
  - Store with NULL `claude_session_id` initially, update later
  - Wait for Claude session ID before injecting
  - Use a placeholder and update via transaction

#### 3. **Migration Approach**

The codebase has no formal migration system:

- Only uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` patterns
- Schema version table exists but isn't used for migrations
- Need to implement:
  ```go
  func (s *SQLiteStore) migrateSchema() error {
      // Check current version
      // Run ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN summary TEXT
      // Populate existing summaries
      // Update schema version
  }
  ```

#### 4. **Event Deduplication**

The plan doesn't address potential duplicate events:

- If query injection fails and is retried
- If the same query appears in Claude's stream
- Need unique constraint or deduplication logic

#### 5. **Continued Session Sequences**

When continuing a session:

- Parent session has events with one `claude_session_id`
- Child session gets a new `claude_session_id`
- Injected query in child session starts at sequence=1 again
- This is actually correct behavior, but the plan should clarify this

### Missing Considerations

#### 1. **Conversation Retrieval Logic**

The plan doesn't mention updating retrieval queries:

- `GetConversation` methods need to handle injected events
- May need to filter or merge events from multiple Claude sessions
- Consider impact on conversation export features

#### 2. **Error Handling**

- What if summary calculation fails?
- What if query injection fails during session launch?
- Need graceful degradation

#### 3. **Performance Impact**

- Additional database write on every session launch
- Impact on session startup time
- Consider async injection after session starts

#### 4. **Testing Gaps**

The plan mentions tests but misses:

- Integration tests for the full flow
- Tests for race conditions
- Tests for migration on existing data
- Performance regression tests

#### 5. **UI Consistency**

- Plan updates SessionTable but not other components
- Need to check all places queries are displayed
- Consider impact on API responses

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Sequence Numbering**

   ```go
   // In injectQueryAsFirstEvent
   event := &store.ConversationEvent{
       SessionID:       sessionID,
       ClaudeSessionID: "", // Empty initially
       Sequence:        1,  // Use 1, not 0
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Handle Claude Session ID**

   ```go
   // Add method to update Claude session ID later
   func (m *Manager) updateInjectedQuerySessionID(sessionID, claudeSessionID string) error {
       // Update the injected event with Claude session ID
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Proper Migration**

   ```go
   func (s *SQLiteStore) addSummaryColumn() error {
       _, err := s.db.Exec(`
           ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN summary TEXT;
           UPDATE sessions SET summary = SUBSTR(
               REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(query, char(10), ' '), char(13), ' '), char(9), ' '),
               1, 47
           ) || '...' WHERE LENGTH(query) > 50;
       `)
       return err
   }
   ```

4. **Add Deduplication Check**

   ```go
   // Before injecting, check if user event already exists
   existing, err := m.store.GetFirstUserEvent(sessionID)
   if err == nil && existing != nil {
       return nil // Already injected
   }
   ```

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Clarify sequence behavior across sessions
   - Document the two-phase approach (inject then update)
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## Architecture Insights

The conversation event system is well-designed with:

- Transaction-based sequence assignment
- Clear separation between HumanLayer and Claude session IDs
- Robust event type system

However, the lack of a formal migration system and the complexity around Claude session ID timing need careful handling.

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)

From `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`:

- "When conversation resumed the new query doesn't get added to the GetConversation view in tui as a user message. Only the original does."
- This confirms the problem the plan is trying to solve

From architecture documents:

- Sessions track both `session_id` (HumanLayer) and `claude_session_id` (Claude)
- Event sequencing is critical for maintaining conversation order

## Open Questions

1. Should we wait for Claude session ID before injecting the query?
2. How do we handle query injection failures gracefully?
3. Should summaries be recalculated when sessions are exported?
4. Do we need to update the API to expose the summary field?
5. Should the injected query event be marked with a special flag?

## Conclusion

The plan is fundamentally sound but needs refinement in several areas:

- Sequence numbering must align with existing patterns
- Claude session ID timing needs a robust solution
- Migration strategy needs to be more concrete
- Edge cases and error handling need more attention

With these improvements, the implementation should successfully solve the query visibility problem while maintaining backward compatibility.
