# Research: Daemon API Architecture Impact on Session Fork Display Solutions

## Research Question

How do the initial/pending future API plans in the daemon API architecture impact the recommended solutions for session fork display? Do the architectural principles and future roadmap affect which approach should be taken?

## Summary

The daemon API architecture strongly reinforces the recommended approach from the session fork display research. The API-first design with strict backwards compatibility requirements makes Option 3 (frontend tree building) the correct short-term choice, while the progressive enhancement philosophy and RESTful evolution patterns make Option 2 (new tree-aware endpoint) the ideal long-term solution. The daemon's event-driven architecture and existing session hierarchy support provide solid foundations for both approaches.

## Detailed Findings

### Daemon API Core Principles

The daemon API architecture reveals several fundamental principles that directly impact session fork display implementation:

1. **Backwards Compatibility is Sacred**: The API commits to never breaking existing endpoints - only extending through new endpoints
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple and add complexity as needed, allowing old clients to continue working
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) provide real-time session status changes
4. **RESTful Resource Design**: Clear separation between collections (`/sessions`) and actions (`/sessions/{id}/continue`)
5. **Server-Side Enrichment**: Backend handles data enrichment while maintaining simple POST operations

### Impact on Session Fork Display Options

#### Option 1: Backend Tree Calculation (Modify listSessions) - **NOT VIABLE**

The daemon API architecture explicitly prohibits this approach:

- **Violates Backwards Compatibility**: Changing `listSessions` to filter results would break existing clients
- **Breaks RESTful Semantics**: Collection endpoints should return all resources, not filtered subsets
- **Against API Evolution Principles**: Core endpoints must never change behavior

#### Option 2: New Tree-Aware Endpoint - **IDEAL LONG-TERM**

This approach perfectly aligns with daemon API patterns:

- **Follows Additive Evolution**: New `/api/v1/sessionTrees` endpoint preserves existing APIs
- **Matches Existing Patterns**: Similar to how `getConversation` provides enriched data beyond basic session info
- **Enables Feature Detection**: Clients can check for endpoint existence and gracefully fallback
- **Supports Progressive Enhancement**: Old clients continue using flat list, new clients get tree structure

#### Option 3: Frontend Tree Building - **CORRECT SHORT-TERM**

This approach respects current API constraints:

- **Zero Backend Changes**: Works with existing API immediately
- **Client-Side Concern**: UI presentation logic belongs in frontend per separation of concerns
- **Preserves Flexibility**: Different UIs (TUI, WUI) can implement different visualizations
- **Natural Migration Path**: Can transition to Option 2 when available

#### Option 4: Virtual Session IDs - **ARCHITECTURALLY INCOMPATIBLE**

This violates core daemon principles:

- **Breaks ID Immutability**: Session IDs are currently stable identifiers
- **Complicates Event System**: Which ID type for SSE events?
- **Violates Transparency**: IDs should be predictable and debuggable

### Session Management Architecture Insights

The daemon already has robust infrastructure for session trees:

1. **Parent-Child Relationships**: `parent_session_id` field exists and is actively used
2. **Session Forking**: `/sessions/{sessionId}/continue` creates child sessions
3. **Event Notifications**: SSE events fire when sessions are created or status changes
4. **Rich Metadata**: Sessions track cost, duration, turns, and error states

This existing infrastructure makes tree visualization a natural extension rather than a fundamental change.

### Event-Driven Patterns for Real-Time Updates

The daemon's SSE architecture provides patterns for dynamic tree updates:

```typescript
// Subscribe to session events
eventSource.addEventListener('session_status_changed', event => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
  if (data.session_id) {
    updateTreeNode(data.session_id, data.status)
  }
})

// New session created (potential fork)
eventSource.addEventListener('session_created', event => {
  const session = JSON.parse(event.data)
  if (session.parent_session_id) {
    addChildToTree(session.parent_session_id, session)
  }
})
```

### Future API Evolution Path

The daemon's phased evolution roadmap suggests how session trees might evolve:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Local daemon with flat session list
2. **Phase 2**: Network-accessible daemon could add tree endpoint for mobile UIs
3. **Phase 3**: Cloud sync might cache tree structures for performance
4. **Phase 4**: Cloud-native could offer team-wide session tree views

## Architecture Insights

### API Design Patterns Supporting Trees

1. **Hierarchical Resources**: The API already models parent-child relationships
2. **Enrichment Pattern**: GET operations can return computed tree structures
3. **Streaming Support**: Large trees could use SSE chunking patterns
4. **Schema Flexibility**: Supports both simple and complex tree representations

### Implementation Guidance from Daemon Patterns

1. **Use Existing Events**: Leverage `session_status_changed` for real-time updates
2. **Follow Resource Patterns**: Trees are computed views of session resources
3. **Respect Backwards Compatibility**: Never modify existing endpoints
4. **Enable Progressive Enhancement**: Support both flat and tree views

- `thoughts/allison/daemon_api/docs/architecture.md` - Reveals API-first design philosophy and backwards compatibility commitment
- `thoughts/allison/daemon_api/docs/design-rationale.md` - Explains why breaking changes are forbidden
- `thoughts/allison/daemon_api/docs/events.md` - Shows existing event infrastructure perfect for tree updates

## Recommended Implementation Path

### Immediate Actions (Frontend Tree Building)

1. Implement tree construction in `useSessions` hook
2. Add fork detection logic (parent with multiple children)
3. Filter to show only leaf nodes unless forked
4. Subscribe to SSE events for real-time updates

### Future Enhancement (Tree-Aware Endpoint)

1. Design `/api/v1/sessionTrees` following RESTful patterns
2. Include computed fields: `hasForked`, `childCount`, `depth`
3. Support query parameters: `?include=all` vs `?include=leaves`
4. Implement server-side caching for performance

### Migration Strategy

1. Frontend continues to work with both endpoints
2. Feature detection checks for tree endpoint availability
3. Graceful fallback to client-side tree building
4. Eventually deprecate client-side logic

## Open Questions

1. Should tree endpoint support pagination for very large trees?
2. How should deleted/archived sessions appear in trees?
3. Should SSE events include tree-specific notifications like "fork_created"?
4. What's the maximum tree depth before UI truncation?

## Conclusion

The daemon API architecture strongly validates the recommended approach: use frontend tree building immediately while planning for a dedicated tree endpoint. The existing architectural principles - particularly backwards compatibility and progressive enhancement - make this the only viable path that respects both current constraints and future extensibility.
