# Research: Force Push to Main Branch - Missing PRs Investigation

**Date**: 2025-06-24 14:31:35 PDT
**Researcher**: allison
**Git Commit**: 24b5bd752e80ef5c416062732989931553712406
**Branch**: main
**Repository**: humanlayer
## Research Question

We had some oopsies on force pushes to main. Think we pushed an old version. Tried to fix it, but not sure if all the changes from all the most recent PRs (last 2 days) are currently here?

## Summary

Yes, there was a force push to main that resulted in the loss of several PRs from June 24, 2025. The force push reverted main back approximately 25 hours to commit `1de077e72067885e0a999eef9de08f10703e0821`. While some PRs were re-applied or consolidated, **two PRs are completely missing**: #235 (make thoughts searchable) and #239 (Initial pass at TODOs).

## Detailed Findings

### Force Push Evidence

- **Reflog confirmation**: `refs/remotes/origin/main@{1} 1de077e72067885e0a999eef9de08f10703e0821 pull: forced-update`
- **Timeline**: Force push occurred after 2025-06-24 13:04:23 PDT
- **Reversion point**: Main was reset to PR #232 from 2025-06-23 11:34:44 PDT

### Lost Commits

The following commits were lost in the force push:

1. `58047ff7` - Merge pull request #241 from humanlayer/thoughts_fix (2025-06-24 13:04:23)
2. `b99cb2e4` - Merge pull request #240 from humanlayer/claude_and_uv (2025-06-24 13:03:51)
3. `7d8e71e7` - make thoughts searchable (#235) (2025-06-24 10:30:01)
4. `15c0b4df` - Initial pass at TODOs (#239) (2025-06-24 12:29:39)

## Architecture Insights

1. **PR Consolidation**: PR #243 appears to have been created by combining multiple branches (theme, CLAUDE.md updates, uv.lock changes)
2. **Recovery Strategy**: Some lost work was recovered by re-applying commits on new branches
3. **Worktree Issues**: The force push may be related to the worktree sync bug documented in the thoughts directory

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)

- `thoughts/allison/worktree_sync_bug_analysis.md` - Documents a critical bug where thoughts sync in a worktree attempted to replace the entire codebase
- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-06-24_14-13-18_worktree_sync_bug_understanding.md` - Detailed analysis of the worktree sync issue
- `thoughts/shared/prs/242_description.md` - PR description for the Gruvbox themes (note: numbered 242, not 243)

The worktree sync bug incident required force pushes to clean up bad auto-sync commits, which may have contributed to the current situation.

## Related Research

- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-06-24_10-42-32_wui_color_schemes_gruvbox.md` - Research behind the Gruvbox theme implementation

## Open Questions

1. Can PR #235 (make thoughts searchable) be recovered from a local branch or reflog?
2. Can PR #239 (Initial pass at TODOs) be recovered or needs to be re-implemented?
3. Should we implement additional safeguards against accidental force pushes to main?
4. Is the worktree sync bug fix from PR #241 actually present in the current codebase?

## Recovery Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Check local repositories for refs to lost commits
2. **PR #235**: Search for branch `make-thoughts-searchable` or commit `7d8e71e7`
3. **PR #239**: Search for TODO-related branches or commit `15c0b4df`
4. **Prevention**: Consider branch protection rules to prevent force pushes to main
