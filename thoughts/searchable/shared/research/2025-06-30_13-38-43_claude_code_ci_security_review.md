# Research: Claude Code CI Security Review - GitHub Actions Integration

**Date**: 2025-06-26 15:38:59 PDT
**Researcher**: dex
**Git Commit**: f928aa2164e9d3684fbdfbd21e9e395b1344326d
**Branch**: add-claude-github-actions-1750717916035
**Repository**: humanlayer

## Research Question
Reviewing and adjusting the Claude Code in CI PR changes with security concerns: anyone from the internet can open a GitHub issue that triggers Claude to do work that may have access to systems, change code, query things, spend our tokens on stuff that doesn't matter, mine for bitcoins, etc. Need to ensure:
1. Action is only triggerable by HumanLayer people
2. Access token has limit to given budget

## Summary

The Claude Code CI integration introduces two new GitHub Actions workflows that pose significant security risks. The PR body claims "Only users with write access to the repository can trigger the workflow," but this is **false**. Currently, **any GitHub user** can trigger Claude Code by commenting "@claude" on issues or PRs, potentially leading to unauthorized API usage, token abuse, and uncontrolled costs.

Key security gaps identified:
- No user permission validation in workflows
- No API budget or rate limiting controls
- Workflows automatically process all PRs without filtering
- Missing organization membership checks
- No protection against malicious actors

## Detailed Findings

### New Workflow Files

Two new workflows were added in the PR:

1. **`.github/workflows/claude.yml`** - Interactive Claude trigger via comments
   - Triggers on any comment containing "@claude"
   - No permission checks implemented
   - Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret

2. **`.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`** - Automatic PR reviews
   - Triggers on all pull requests automatically
   - No author filtering enabled
   - Uses same API key

### Critical Security Issue: False Security Claim

The PR body states:
> "Only users with write access to the repository can trigger the workflow"

However, the actual implementation shows:
- **Lines 15-19 in `claude.yml`**: Only checks if comment contains "@claude"
- **No validation** of `github.event.comment.author_association`
- **No permission checks** for write access or organization membership

This means any GitHub user (including those with no association to the repository) can trigger Claude and consume API tokens.

### Missing Access Controls

The codebase analysis revealed:
- **No GitHub user validation** - `/humanlayer/core/cloud.py:31-36`
- **No team/organization checks** - Not implemented anywhere
- **No budget/usage limits** - No code for tracking API costs
- **Single API key model** - `/hld/config/config.go:47-48`

### Workflow Permission Analysis

Both workflows use restricted permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read
  issues: read
  id-token: write
```

While this limits what the workflow can do, it doesn't control who can trigger it.

### Historical Context from thoughts/

The thoughts/ directory shows extensive planning for VM infrastructure security but lacks specific guidance on:
- API usage budget controls
- Preventing unauthorized Claude Code triggers
- CI/CD-specific security measures

## Code References

- `.github/workflows/claude.yml:15-19` - Missing permission checks
- `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml:28-32` - Workflow permissions
- `/humanlayer/core/cloud.py:31-36` - API key authentication
- `/hld/daemon/daemon.go:21-23` - Local socket security
- `thoughts/global/dex/specs/vm-infrastructure/resource-management.md` - Budget planning (not implemented)

## Architecture Insights

1. **Authentication Flow**: Uses Bearer token authentication with a single API key
2. **No Multi-tenancy**: System lacks user-specific authentication
3. **Local Security**: Unix socket with 0600 permissions for local daemon
4. **Missing Budget Controls**: Despite infrastructure specs mentioning cost controls, no implementation exists

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)

- `thoughts/global/dex/specs/vm-infrastructure/resource-management.md` - Shows planning for budget controls with max_hourly_cost limits
- `thoughts/global/dex/specs/vm-infrastructure/networking-security.md` - Emphasizes zero-trust and audit logging
- `thoughts/shared/weekly-updates/2024-11-05.md` - Mentions DeployBot as internal CI/CD with human-in-the-loop approvals

Note: These specs show intent but are not implemented in the current Claude Code integration.

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add Permission Validation** to workflows:
```yaml
jobs:
  claude:
    if: |
      contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude') &&
      (github.event.comment.author_association == 'OWNER' ||
       github.event.comment.author_association == 'MEMBER' ||
       github.event.comment.author_association == 'COLLABORATOR')
```

2. **Implement Organization Membership Check**:
```yaml
- name: Check org membership
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      try {
        await github.rest.orgs.checkMembershipForUser({
          org: 'humanlayer',
          username: context.actor
        });
      } catch (error) {
        core.setFailed('User is not a member of the organization');
      }
```

3. **Enable Approval Requirements**:
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Enable "Require approval for all external contributors"

4. **Implement Budget Controls**:
   - Set rate limits on the Anthropic API key
   - Monitor usage through Anthropic dashboard
   - Consider using separate API keys for CI with lower limits

5. **Filter Automatic Reviews**:
   - Uncomment author filtering in `claude-code-review.yml`
   - Limit to specific file types or paths

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Implement Token Scoping**: Create CI-specific API keys with usage limits
2. **Add Usage Tracking**: Build monitoring for API consumption per trigger
3. **Create Allowlist**: Maintain list of approved users who can trigger Claude
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all Claude invocations with trigger source
5. **Progressive Rollout**: Start with manual approval before full automation

## Open Questions
1. What is the expected monthly budget for Claude Code API usage?
2. Should we restrict Claude to specific repositories or branches?
3. Do we need different permission levels for different Claude capabilities?
4. Should external contributors ever be able to trigger Claude?
