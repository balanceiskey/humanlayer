## What problem(s) was I solving?

- Improving developer experience by adding essential developer tooling and commands for Claude Code
- Establishing clear code quality conventions with a TODO priority system 
- Providing better worktree management for developers using git worktrees with the thoughts directory
- Adding `make setup` command was missing from CLAUDE.md despite being available in the Makefile

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- Added two new Claude Code commands:
  - `/describe_pr` - Automatically generates comprehensive PR descriptions following the repository template
  - `/research_codebase` - Conducts thorough codebase research using parallel sub-agents
- Added TODO priority annotation system documentation to both README.md and CLAUDE.md
- Added `hack/cleanup_worktree.sh` script for safely cleaning up git worktrees that use the thoughts directory
- Added `make setup` command to CLAUDE.md quick actions section

## How I implemented it

- Created `.claude/commands/` directory structure for custom Claude Code commands
- Implemented `/describe_pr` command that:
  - Reads the PR template from thoughts directory
  - Gathers PR metadata, diff, and commit history
  - Runs verification commands automatically
  - Generates and saves description to `thoughts/shared/prs/{number}_description.md`
  - Updates the PR description on GitHub
- Implemented `/research_codebase` command that:
  - Spawns parallel Task agents for efficient research
  - Explores both codebase and thoughts directory
  - Generates timestamped research documents with YAML frontmatter
  - Supports follow-up questions by updating the same document
- Added TODO annotation convention documentation with priority levels 0-4 and PERF
- Created `cleanup_worktree.sh` script that handles thoughts directory permissions and cleanup before removing worktrees
- Updated CLAUDE.md with missing `make setup` command in the quick actions

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes

## Description for the changelog

Added Claude Code commands for PR descriptions and codebase research, established TODO priority system, improved worktree cleanup tooling, and updated developer documentation
