## What problem(s) was I solving?

The SessionLauncher component had several usability issues that made it frustrating to use:
- Pressing Enter in the working directory field didn't launch the session
- The Escape key wasn't properly handled, preventing users from dismissing the launcher
- Focus management was broken, causing keyboard shortcuts to conflict when the launcher was open
- The directory selector showed hardcoded suggestions instead of actual directories from the file system

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- **Fixed Enter key**: Users can now press Enter in the working directory field to launch a session
- **Fixed Escape key**: Pressing Escape now properly blurs the input and allows dismissing the launcher
- **Real directory browsing**: The working directory field now shows actual directories from your file system with fuzzy search
- **Better keyboard navigation**: Added full keyboard support with arrow keys, Tab, and Enter
- **Path validation**: Invalid paths now show a warning icon with visual feedback
- **Improved focus management**: Fixed keyboard shortcut conflicts when the launcher is open

## How I implemented it

### 1. Created a new SearchInput component with file system integration
- Built a fuzzy search autocomplete that reads directories using Tauri's file system API
- Implemented smart fuzzy matching with scoring based on consecutive matches and word boundaries
- Added keyboard navigation with proper focus management
- Handles `~` expansion to home directory

### 2. Fixed the escape/focus issues
- Added escape key handlers in both FuzzySearchInput and CommandInput components
- Used `stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling
- Implemented programmatic blur using element IDs (temporary workaround)

### 3. Integrated Tauri file system plugin
- Added `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs` dependency for reading directories
- Configured proper permissions in `capabilities/default.json`
- Added Rust-side plugin in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

### 4. Refactored SessionLauncher
- Added proper `onSubmit` callback handling for Enter key
- Improved focus management with `focusSearchInput` function
- Fixed keyboard shortcut handling to prevent conflicts

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes
- [ ] Manual testing: Open the SessionLauncher and verify:
  - Typing shows real directories from your file system
  - Arrow keys navigate the suggestions
  - Tab selects a suggestion
  - Enter launches the session
  - Escape blurs the input
  - Invalid paths show a warning icon
  - Keyboard shortcuts don't interfere when launcher is open

## Description for the changelog

Fixed SessionLauncher keyboard navigation and focus issues. Users can now press Enter to launch sessions, use Escape to dismiss inputs, and browse real directories from their file system with fuzzy search. Added proper keyboard navigation with arrow keys and improved error handling for invalid paths.
