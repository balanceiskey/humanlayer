## What problem(s) was I solving?

The event subscription system between the HumanLayer daemon (hld) and the web UI (humanlayer-wui) was failing silently, making it difficult to diagnose why events weren't propagating correctly. The lack of visibility into the event flow made debugging subscription issues nearly impossible, especially when dealing with session-specific event filtering.

Additionally, the session continuation feature was encountering edge cases where sessions without proper working directories could not be resumed, leading to confusing error states.

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- **Improved debugging experience**: Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the event system, making it much easier to diagnose subscription and event propagation issues
- **Better error handling**: Added validation to ensure sessions have required fields (like working_dir) before allowing continuation
- **Enhanced UI feedback**: The web UI now shows clearer status indicators and messages when continuing sessions

## How I implemented it

### Event System Debugging Enhancements

- Added detailed debug logging to the event bus publish/subscribe flow in `hld/bus/events.go`
- Enhanced the subscription handlers in `hld/rpc/subscription_handlers.go` to log filter parameters and event notifications
- Added logging to the session manager when publishing status change events
- Enhanced the web UI's event handling to log received events for debugging

### Session Management Improvements

- Added validation in `ContinueSession` to check for required `working_dir` field
- Added logic to capture current working directory when launching sessions if not specified
- Updated integration tests to use valid working directories (`/tmp`) to avoid test failures
- Fixed the web UI to properly handle parent session navigation and continuation

### Code Quality

- Replaced Info-level logs with Debug-level logs where appropriate to reduce noise
- Added structured logging fields for better searchability
- Maintained backward compatibility while improving error messages

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes

Additional verification:

- Start the daemon with debug logging enabled to see the enhanced event flow
- Try subscribing to events from the web UI and verify events are received
- Test continuing a session that lacks a working directory to see the improved error message
- Monitor logs while performing session operations to see the new debug information

## Description for the changelog

Enhanced event system debugging and session continuation reliability:

- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the event subscription system
- Fixed session continuation to validate required fields like working_dir
- Improved error messages and UI feedback for session operations
