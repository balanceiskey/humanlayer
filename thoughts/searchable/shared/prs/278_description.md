## What problem(s) was I solving?

- The `SessionDetail.tsx` file had grown to 1,691 lines, making it difficult to navigate, understand, and maintain
- Multiple concerns were mixed together in a single file: UI components, utility functions, event processing logic, and view rendering
- Finding specific functionality required scrolling through a massive file, slowing down development

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- No user-facing changes - this is a pure refactoring effort
- All functionality remains identical from the user's perspective
- The UI, interactions, and behavior are preserved exactly as before

## How I implemented it

I extracted the monolithic `SessionDetail.tsx` into a modular directory structure:

```
SessionDetail/
├── index.tsx                    # Module exports
├── SessionDetail.tsx            # Main component (reduced from 1,691 to ~400 lines)
├── components/                  # Extracted UI components
│   ├── DenyForm.tsx            # Approval denial form component
│   ├── DiffViewToggle.tsx      # Diff view toggle button
│   ├── TodoWidget.tsx          # TODO list display widget
│   └── ToolResultModal.tsx     # Modal for expanded tool results
├── views/                      # View components
│   └── ConversationContent.tsx # Main conversation display logic
├── eventToDisplayObject.tsx    # Event transformation logic (~700 lines)
└── formatToolResult.tsx        # Tool result formatting utilities
```

Key improvements:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each file now has a single, clear responsibility
- **Better organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Easier navigation**: Finding specific components or functions is now straightforward
- **Type safety**: Maintained all TypeScript types and interfaces
- **No behavior changes**: This is a pure refactoring with no functional modifications

The main `SessionDetail.tsx` now focuses solely on orchestrating the overall component, while delegating specific responsibilities to the extracted modules.

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes

Additional manual verification steps:
- [ ] Open the HumanLayer WUI and navigate to an active session
- [ ] Verify all session detail functionality works as before:
  - [ ] Event display and scrolling
  - [ ] Tool call expansion/collapse
  - [ ] Approval/denial workflows
  - [ ] TODO widget display
  - [ ] Diff view toggle for Edit/MultiEdit operations
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (i, j, k, A, D, etc.)
  - [ ] Response input and session continuation

## Description for the changelog

Refactored SessionDetail component from a 1,691-line monolith into a well-organized module structure with separated concerns for improved maintainability
