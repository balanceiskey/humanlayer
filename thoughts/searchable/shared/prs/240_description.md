## What problem(s) was I solving?

- The CLAUDE.md file contained overly prescriptive persona-based instructions that were confusing and added unnecessary complexity to the development workflow
- The uv.lock file was outdated and needed to be regenerated with a newer version of uv (0.7.14) to maintain compatibility

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- Simplified CLAUDE.md to provide clear, structured guidance for Claude Code without mandatory persona selection
- Updated dependency lock file to ensure reproducible builds with current tooling

## How I implemented it

- Rewrote CLAUDE.md to focus on practical repository structure and development commands
- Removed the mandatory persona system and complex 1500-line reading rules
- Organized content into two main project groups: HumanLayer SDK & Platform and Local Tools Suite
- Added clear sections for development commands, technical guidelines, and quick actions
- Regenerated uv.lock with uv version 0.7.14, which added revision metadata and upload timestamps

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes

## Description for the changelog

Updated CLAUDE.md with clearer repository documentation and regenerated uv.lock with uv 0.7.14
