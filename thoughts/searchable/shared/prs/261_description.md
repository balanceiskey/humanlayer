## What problem(s) was I solving?

- The HumanLayer daemon (`hld`) had complex dependencies on the HumanLayer cloud API for managing approvals, requiring API keys and network connectivity
- The approval system involved complex polling, correlation, and type conversions between local and remote approval formats
- Managing the relationship between local tool calls and remote approvals required ~1800 lines of complex synchronization code
- Users needed HumanLayer API keys even for local-only approval workflows
- The MCP server had to repeatedly fetch all pending approvals to check status, causing unnecessary overhead

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- **No breaking changes** - All existing RPC interfaces and CLI commands continue to work exactly as before
- **No API key required** - Users can now use the approval system without any HumanLayer account or API credentials
- **Faster approvals** - Approvals are now instant with no network latency, improving the Claude Code experience
- **100% local operation** - All approval data stays on the user's machine with no external dependencies
- **More efficient polling** - MCP server now polls individual approvals instead of fetching the entire list

## How I implemented it

Following the plan in `thoughts/allison/plans/local_approvals_v2.md`, I completely replaced the HumanLayer API-based approval system with a local SQLite-based implementation:

1. **Added approvals table to SQLite** - Created a simple schema to store approvals locally with fields for `id`, `run_id`, `session_id`, `status`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `comment`

2. **Removed all API dependencies** - Deleted ~1800 lines of code including:
   - `poller.go` - API polling logic
   - `correlator.go` - In-memory remote approval store
   - Complex type conversions and API client code
   - All associated test files

3. **Simplified approval manager** - Rewrote `approval/manager.go` to:
   - Create approvals directly in SQLite
   - Automatically correlate with pending tool calls
   - Update session status to `waiting_input`
   - Publish events for real-time UI updates

4. **Updated RPC handlers** - Modified to work with local approvals while maintaining backward compatibility:
   - `createApproval` - Creates local approvals in SQLite
   - `fetchApprovals` - Queries local database
   - `sendDecision` - Updates local approval status
   - **NEW** `getApproval` - Retrieves a specific approval by ID for efficient polling

5. **Updated MCP integration** - Changed `hlyr` to:
   - Create local approvals via RPC instead of using the HumanLayer SDK
   - Use the new `getApproval` endpoint for efficient status polling
   - Add dedicated MCP logger for better debugging

6. **Updated TUI** - Modified to work with the new simplified approval format

7. **Added test tooling** - Created comprehensive testing infrastructure:
   - `hack/test-local-approvals.ts` - Automated and interactive test script
   - `test_local_approvals.md` - Detailed testing documentation
   - Automated test mode that approves after 2 seconds for CI/CD

8. **Added database migration** - Migration 4 creates the approvals table for existing databases

The architecture flow changed from:
```
Claude → MCP → hlyr → HumanLayer SDK → HumanLayer API → Polling → hld → TUI/WUI
```

To:
```
Claude → MCP → hlyr → JSON-RPC → hld (SQLite) → TUI/WUI
```

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes
- [x] Test creating approvals through Claude Code
- [x] Verify TUI shows pending approvals correctly
- [x] Verify WUI shows pending approvals correctly
- [x] Test approve/deny functionality in both TUI and WUI
- [x] Verify the approval flow completes successfully end-to-end

**Additional verification:**
- Run the automated test: `bun hack/test-local-approvals.ts --test` from the `hlyr` directory
- See `hlyr/test_local_approvals.md` for comprehensive testing instructions

## Description for the changelog

Implement local-only approvals, removing HumanLayer API dependencies. The approval system now operates entirely locally using SQLite, improving performance and removing the need for API keys while maintaining full backward compatibility. Added efficient single-approval polling and comprehensive test tooling.
