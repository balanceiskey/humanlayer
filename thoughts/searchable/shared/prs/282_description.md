## What problem(s) was I solving?

- Need for a structured workflow to turn ideas and tickets into implemented, verified code
- Lack of standardized approach for creating, executing, and validating technical implementation plans
- Missing tooling to track progress through complex multi-phase implementations

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- Added three new Claude Code commands that work together as a complete implementation workflow:
  - `/create_plan` - Creates detailed technical plans through interactive discovery and research
  - `/implement_plan` - Executes approved plans phase-by-phase with progress tracking
  - `/validate_plan` - Verifies implementations match their specifications
- Renamed existing `implementation_plan.md` to `create_plan.md` for clarity

## How I implemented it

- Created comprehensive command documentation files in `.claude/commands/` that define:
  - Interactive workflows for each command
  - Integration points between commands (plans stored in `thoughts/shared/plans/`)
  - Progress tracking via checkboxes in plan files
  - Structured validation reporting
- Emphasized thorough research with parallel task spawning for discovery
- Separated automated verification (commands) from manual verification (UI/UX) throughout
- Built in clear communication patterns for handling mismatches between plans and reality

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes (Note: pre-existing test failure in claudecode-go unrelated to these changes)
- [ ] Test the complete workflow by:
  1. Using `/create_plan` to create a technical plan from a ticket
  2. Using `/implement_plan` to execute the plan
  3. Using `/validate_plan` to verify the implementation
- [ ] Verify that plans are created in `thoughts/shared/plans/` with the expected template structure
- [ ] Confirm that progress checkboxes update correctly during implementation
- [ ] Check that validation reports accurately reflect implementation status

## Description for the changelog

Add structured plan workflow commands for Claude Code: create_plan, implement_plan, and validate_plan for turning ideas into verified implementations
