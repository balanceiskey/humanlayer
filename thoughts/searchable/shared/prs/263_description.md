## What problem(s) was I solving?

When using the HumanLayer WUI (Web UI) to review and approve/deny function calls, users had to click the Approve/Deny buttons with their mouse for each approval request. This was inefficient, especially when dealing with multiple approvals in sequence. Additionally, when denying a request with the 'D' hotkey, it would immediately deny with a generic message ("Denied via hotkey") without giving users a chance to provide a meaningful reason for the denial.

## What user-facing changes did I ship?

- **Keyboard shortcuts for Approve/Deny**: Users can now press 'A' to approve and 'D' to deny function calls, matching the keyboard hints already displayed in the UI
- **Deny with reason**: When pressing 'D', a form now appears allowing users to type a denial reason (with Enter to submit, Escape to cancel)
- **Smart focus behavior**: When pressing 'A' or 'D', the system automatically focuses on the pending approval if not already focused
- **Confirmation for out-of-view approvals**: If the pending approval is scrolled out of view when pressing 'A', the button shows "Approve?" requiring a second press to confirm
- **Visual indicator for pending approvals**: When an approval is waiting below the fold, a "Pending Approval" bar appears at the bottom with a bouncing chevron
- **Improved keyboard navigation**: Better handling of J/K navigation keys to avoid jumping past the first/last items

## How I implemented it

The implementation focused on enhancing the `SessionDetail` component in `humanlayer-wui/src/components/internal/SessionDetail.tsx`:

1. **Hotkey Implementation**: Added `useHotkeys` hooks for 'A' and 'D' keys that:
   - Find any pending approval in the conversation
   - Focus on it if not already focused
   - Handle the approval/denial action appropriately

2. **State Management**: Added new state variables to track:
   - `confirmingApprovalId`: For two-step approval when element is out of view
   - `denyingApprovalId`: To show/hide the deny form
   - `focusSource`: To differentiate between keyboard and mouse navigation

3. **Deny Form Enhancement**: Enhanced the `DenyForm` component to:
   - Support keyboard shortcuts (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel)
   - Show keyboard hints in the UI
   - Auto-focus the input field

4. **Scroll Behavior**: Implemented smart scrolling that:
   - Scrolls to pending approvals when using keyboard shortcuts
   - Scrolls to the deny form when it appears
   - Detects when pending approvals are out of view

5. **Visual Feedback**: Added a status bar that appears when there are pending approvals below the visible area, allowing users to click to scroll down

6. **Minor Fixes**:
   - Fixed ESLint configuration to properly parse TypeScript config files
   - Added React DevTools support in Vite config for better debugging

## How to verify it

- [x] I have ensured `make check test` passes

**Manual testing steps:**

1. Open the HumanLayer WUI with a session that has pending approvals
2. Press 'A' to approve the current pending request (should work immediately if visible)
3. Press 'D' to deny - a form should appear where you can type a reason
4. Type a reason and press Enter to submit (or Escape to cancel)
5. Use J/K to navigate between events
6. When a pending approval is scrolled out of view, press 'A' - it should scroll to it and show "Approve?" requiring a second press
7. Verify the "Pending Approval" bar appears at the bottom when approvals are waiting below the fold

## Description for the changelog

Enhanced the WUI approval experience with keyboard shortcuts: press 'A' to approve and 'D' to deny (with custom reason). Added visual indicators for out-of-view pending approvals and improved keyboard navigation.
