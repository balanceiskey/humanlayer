[ENG-1454] Remove chmod restrictions from searchable thoughts directory to fix permission bug
Status: ready for dev
Assignee: allison@humanlayer.dev

Description:
The thoughts searchable directory implementation uses hard links with chmod 444, which makes both the hard link AND the original source files read-only. This prevents users from editing their own thoughts files after running sync.

## Context

We implemented the searchable directory to solve a key problem: AI search tools (grep, ripgrep, Claude) don't follow symlinks by default. The solution was to create hard links in a searchable/ directory that tools could traverse.

However, we added chmod 444 restrictions hoping to:

1. Prevent accidental edits to the "wrong" copy
2. Encourage AI agents to use canonical paths (`thoughts/allison/`) instead of searchable paths (`thoughts/searchable/allison/`)

This approach fundamentally misunderstood how hard links work - they share the same inode, so permissions affect ALL links to the file.

## The Real Problem: Path Hygiene

The actual issue isn't preventing edits (both paths point to the same file), but ensuring AI agents reference files by their canonical paths for consistency and clarity.

## Potential Solutions

### 1\. **Remove Permission Restrictions** (Simplest)

* Comment out chmod commands in `hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/sync.ts:167-177`
* Pros: Immediate fix, maintains all functionality
* Cons: Doesn't enforce path hygiene

### 2\. **Documentation/Training Approach**

* Update [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) with explicit path reference rules
* Instruct AI to always translate searchable/ paths to canonical paths
* Pros: Low implementation effort, educational
* Cons: Relies on AI compliance

### 3\. **Path Translation in Tools**

* Modify search outputs to automatically strip "searchable/" from paths
* Pros: Enforces correct paths at tool level
* Cons: Requires modifying multiple tools

### 4\. **Alternative Search Implementations**

* Consider symlink-following flags for search tools
* Investigate virtual file system approaches
* Pros: Could eliminate need for searchable/ entirely
* Cons: Major architectural change

## Recommendation

Start with solution #1 (remove chmod) + solution #2 (documentation) as they:

* Fix the immediate bug
* Are non-breaking changes
* Can be enhanced later with path translation if needed

## Implementation Notes

* chmod removal: `hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/sync.ts:167-177`
* Related workaround: `hack/cleanup_worktree.sh:48-54`
* Permission reset pattern: `hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/init.ts:493-498`
