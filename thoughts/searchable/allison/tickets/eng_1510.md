[ENG-1510] After switching to session leaves, the session view in WUI doesn't update to the "right" view until next poll
Status: Spec Needed

Description:
[ENG-1491](https://linear.app/humanlayer/issue/ENG-1491/implement-getsessionleaves-json-rpc-endpoint-to-show-only-leaf)  is related ticket. Loom in there where I discovered this. Link is here as well: [https://www.loom.com/share/778f2964d24445da8e40ef4e4078799f](https://www.loom.com/share/778f2964d24445da8e40ef4e4078799f)

I did a brief ask of claude for options. It thought this was the potential best:

```
  1. Reactive Approach (Recommended) âœ…

  After successful continueSession, immediately call refreshSessions() from the store.

  Pros:
  - Simple and reliable
  - Maintains single source of truth (backend)
  - No complex state management needed
  - Uses existing infrastructure

  Cons:
  - One extra API call
```

But to avoid scope creep I'm creating this triage to be done as a follow up.

### Steps to repro

pull latest main

resume session

view state glitch
