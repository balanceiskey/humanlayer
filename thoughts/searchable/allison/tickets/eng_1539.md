[ENG-1539] Create a plan-implementing command (to run off of plans created by implementation_plan)
Status: in dev
Assignee: allison@humanlayer.dev

Description:
* Not urgent, but can likely get to it sometime this week. Will want to run through probably 2-3 new pieces of work based off of the plans generated by the new `implementation_plan` command to get a groove of what needs to be included in it.

No comments on this issue.
