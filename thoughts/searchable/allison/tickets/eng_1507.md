[ENG-1507] Add CLAUDE.md file to `humanlayer-tui` that explains it is archived
Status: Triage

Description:
* If claude code reads anything inside of humanlayer-tui it'll automatically pull up `humanlayer-tui/CLAUDE.md` at the same time. Idea is to have explicit information like "This is archived, we won't be building features into tui anymore, we won't be making modifications, it can be used for reference when needed, but don't include it in any plans or implementations."
  
  Basically to avoid auto-generated research saying silly things.
