[ENG-1452] Add automatic git pull to thoughts synchronization
Status: Spec Needed

Description:
The thoughts system currently only pushes changes but never pulls updates from other team members. This creates a one-way sync where users miss updates unless they manually pull in the thoughts repository.

## Key Details

* Current implementation is push-only (`hlyr/src/commands/thoughts/sync.ts:58`)
* Post-commit hook only triggers push, not pull
* Multiple architectural options available (polling, file watching, scheduled)
* Need to handle merge conflicts gracefully
* Authentication for private repos during background pulls

## Implementation Options

1. **Simple**: Add pull before push in sync command
2. **Event-driven**: Use hld's polling infrastructure
3. **File watcher**: Monitor `.git/refs/remotes` for changes
4. **Scheduled**: Cron-like system in daemon

## Open Questions

* Should auto-pull be opt-in or default?
* How to handle merge conflicts?
* User notifications for pulled changes?
