[ENG-1447] Claude in CI
Status: Todo

Description:
concern is that anyone from the internet can open a github issue that triggers claude to do work that may have access to systems, change code, query things, spend our tokens on stuff that doesn't matter, mine for bitcoins, whatever

- Make sure action is only triggerable by HumanLayer peeps
- Make sure access token has limit to given budget

No comments on this issue.
