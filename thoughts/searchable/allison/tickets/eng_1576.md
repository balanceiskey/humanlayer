[ENG-1576] Improve WUI chat input to support multi-line text and better wrapping
Status: Triage

Description:
The WUI conversation input currently uses a single-line HTML `<input>` element that doesn't wrap text or support multi-line entry, making it disorienting to write longer prompts. The text also displays smaller than ideal (14px on mobile, 16px on desktop).

## Key Details

* Current implementation uses basic `<Input>` component instead of `<textarea>`
* Text continues horizontally without wrapping in the input field
* No support for Shift+Enter to create new lines
* Text size is responsive but relatively small by default

## Solution

* Replace single-line input with a textarea component
* Enable automatic text wrapping and multi-line support
* Support Shift+Enter for new lines, Enter to send
* Consider increasing default text size or making it configurable

This improvement complements ENG-1554's goal of making the response input always visible. As we're updating the input component to be persistent, it's an ideal time to also enhance the text input experience with proper multi-line support and text wrapping.
