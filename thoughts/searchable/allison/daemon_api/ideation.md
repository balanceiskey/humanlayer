# Conversation with an ai model

## My initial question

"How to write multi language type safe apis and Server sent events? Like typescript and go and rust should all be able to share type safety ideally. Technically the backend is currently in go but it might end up being typescript or rust later. Then the frontend is actually all 3 currently with different frontend targets (CLI, tui, web, etc)"

## It responded in ways that you'd likely expect. I then followed up with:

openAPI probably seems reasonable. For it do I have generated server code too or just I have to make sure my server implementation matches the spec and then get client side generation? And that works with types too? Like I can ensure type safety with openAPI spec? Currently I'm using jsonrpc over unix sockets and I manually wrote client code for rust and typescript to connect to the daemon written in go. Then the daemon has its own client logic exported as a library for other go projects to use. It has a couple endpoints for different things and then has an event bus system that is subscribed to separately when you open a new rpc connection. The next step is I may want to have the daemon still on a local system but to have it connect over the network from somewhere locally. Then I'll potentially end up writing a typescript version of the daemon that runs in the cloud. Then I'm thinking of using Tauri for native desktop and mobile apps. The use case is a couple things. The backend database is just sqlite right now and it might stay that way or may change. Not the biggest or most important piece of the puzzle. It is a tool that launches coding agents and works with human in the loop for approvals. The events can be when a chat session changes state or when a new approval comes in. There may be more events later. The current rpc endpoints are to create a new "agentic session", to get the full conversation details of a specific question, to get approval request, to approve a request, to deny a request with feedback, and to resume a session (basically fork an existing context with the same or different parameters and continue from where it is). It's working reasonably well now, but as we add the Tauri client side (before we just had a go tui and a typescript cli) and start to look at remote connections it makes me wonder if json rpc is really the right approach. Plus I end up having to rewrite the daemon clients from scratch in each language and thus kinda extend the potential locations of failure. The go side daemon client is super well tested but the typescript and rust ones are more sorta slopped together. There is a potential use case where we might end up wanting a local daemon to still run but to have it sync data to our cloud and have remote clients connect from there. If we do that, then the cloud API would probably look very similar if not identical to the daemon one, but the api that the daemon uses to send up it's data might look different. Like, for example, right now the daemon launches the agent locally and thus has access to all of the agent context window events locally and stores them in sqlite. We'll want the context window to be in the cloud too. But the cloud cannot be a client that fecthes context from the random daemon. So we'll need to figure out the best way to send the context window to the cloud API and whether or not that should be streaming oriented or not. It likely would best be done with streaming so that the eventual downstream mobile or web app can see events quickly. Because mobile app->cloud API->daemon on laptop (source of truth) is a lot of hops. Good thing is that right now the daemon is the source of truth but we have potential to make the cloud service the source of truth if you're in remote access mode or whatever. Then we also have the potential to launch agents in the cloud and thus avoid the daemon on a client. But ideally we support all of the possible solutions. In addition to context being sent up, there is potential for us to need context sent alongside tool call approvals. Like imagine a coding agent who wants to edit a file and it is sending a find (existing code) and replace (new code) as well as the file path for what to edit. An important thing for us to be able to make that a good editing experience is to have the full file contents so we can potentially show a prettier diff view than just what was sent (maybe in-between code that wasn't in the diff itself but relevant for context). If it's just daemon->tui or daemon->local Tauri then that's not too hard. We can read the file from the disk in either of those scenarios and dynamically choose how to view the diff tool call based on the parameters passed (file path). But if we either go daemon->remote clients or daemon->cloud->remote clients then that becomes a harder problem does all this make sense? Do you have any recommendations for how I should think about this? Then finally there is potential for us to want to expand this system behind just coding agents. Maybe we'll want to support human in the loop for all sorts of different agentic tool calls. Maybe we'll write advanced routing logic to see whether or not an approval is needed on the cloud API. Maybe the scenario of the file for context being used for an enriched approval experience on file changes is one clean example but perhaps another tool call has different requirements for how best to visualize it and maybe it needs something else? How do we account for these potential future desires while choosing which direction to go initially with the tech stack?

## And it gave me the response:

This is a really well-thought-out problem description. You're essentially building a distributed human-in-the-loop agent orchestration system that needs to scale from local-only to hybrid local/cloud to fully cloud-native. Let me break down my recommendations:

Given your requirements, I'd suggest a **hybrid approach** that uses:

1. **OpenAPI for command/query operations** (create session, get conversation, approve/deny)
2. **SSE or WebSockets for event streaming** (state changes, approvals)
3. **Protocol-agnostic core** that can adapt to different transports

Here's why this makes sense for your use case:

### 1. Transport Layer Abstraction

First, abstract your transport layer so you can support multiple protocols:

```go
// daemon/api/transport.go
type Handler interface {
    CreateSession(ctx context.Context, req CreateSessionRequest) (*Session, error)
    GetConversation(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Conversation, error)
    GetApproval(ctx context.Context, id string) (*ApprovalRequest, error)
    // ... etc
}

type EventStream interface {
    Subscribe(ctx context.Context, filter EventFilter) (<-chan Event, error)
}

// Then implement for different transports
type JSONRPCHandler struct { handler Handler }
type HTTPHandler struct { handler Handler }
type GRPCHandler struct { handler Handler }
```

### 2. OpenAPI-First Design

Define your API in OpenAPI, but generate both server stubs AND clients:

```yaml
# api/openapi.yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
  /sessions:
    post:
      operationId: createSession
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateSessionRequest'
      responses:
        200:
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Session'

  /approvals/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getApproval
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
    put:
      operationId: respondToApproval
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              oneOf:
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApprovalResponse'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/DenialResponse'
              discriminator:
                propertyName: type

  # SSE endpoint for events
  /events:
    get:
      operationId: streamEvents
      parameters:
        - name: session_id
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Server-sent event stream
          content:
            text/event-stream:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Event'

components:
  schemas:
    ApprovalRequest:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        type:
          type: string
          enum: [file_edit, command_execution, api_call]
        context:
          type: object
          # This is key - context is polymorphic based on type
        metadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApprovalMetadata'

    ApprovalMetadata:
      type: object
      properties:
        requiredContext:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
            enum: [file_contents, directory_listing, env_vars]
```

### 3. Context Enrichment Strategy

For your file diff example, implement a context enrichment layer:

```typescript
// shared/types/approvals.ts
interface ApprovalContext {
  type: string
  data: unknown
}

interface FileEditContext extends ApprovalContext {
  type: 'file_edit'
  data: {
    filePath: string
    find: string
    replace: string
    fileContents?: string // Optional, enriched by client
  }
}

// client/enrichment.ts
class ApprovalEnricher {
  async enrich(approval: ApprovalRequest): Promise<ApprovalRequest> {
    switch (approval.type) {
      case 'file_edit':
        return this.enrichFileEdit(approval)
      case 'command_execution':
        return this.enrichCommand(approval)
      // Extensible for future approval types
    }
  }

  private async enrichFileEdit(approval: ApprovalRequest): Promise<ApprovalRequest> {
    const context = approval.context as FileEditContext
    if (this.isLocal && !context.data.fileContents) {
      // Read file locally if possible
      context.data.fileContents = await fs.readFile(context.data.filePath, 'utf-8')
    }
    return approval
  }
}
```

### 4. Daemon-to-Cloud Sync Architecture

For the daemon-to-cloud sync, use a **dual-mode design**:

```go
// daemon/sync/sync.go
type DaemonMode string

const (
    ModeStandalone DaemonMode = "standalone"  // Local only
    ModePrimary    DaemonMode = "primary"     // Local with cloud sync
    ModeRemote     DaemonMode = "remote"      // Cloud is source of truth
)

type CloudSync interface {
    // For pushing updates to cloud
    PushContextWindow(session string, events []ContextEvent) error
    StreamContextUpdates(session string) (<-chan ContextEvent, error)

    // For approval flow
    RequestApproval(req ApprovalRequest) (*ApprovalResponse, error)
}

// The daemon can act as both server (for local clients) and client (to cloud)
type Daemon struct {
    mode      DaemonMode
    cloudSync CloudSync // nil in standalone mode

    // Local API handlers
    handlers  Handler
    events    EventStream
}
```

### 5. Event Streaming Architecture

Use SSE for web clients and WebSockets for native apps:

```typescript
// client/events.ts
interface EventClient {
  subscribe(filter: EventFilter): Observable<Event>
}

class SSEEventClient implements EventClient {
  subscribe(filter: EventFilter): Observable<Event> {
    return new Observable(subscriber => {
      const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/events?${qs.stringify(filter)}`)
      eventSource.onmessage = e => {
        subscriber.next(JSON.parse(e.data))
      }
      return () => eventSource.close()
    })
  }
}

class WebSocketEventClient implements EventClient {
  // Similar but with WebSocket
}

// Factory based on environment
function createEventClient(): EventClient {
  if (isTauri()) return new WebSocketEventClient()
  if (isWeb()) return new SSEEventClient()
  if (isLocal()) return new UnixSocketClient()
}
```

### 6. Migration Path

Here's how I'd approach the migration:

**Phase 1: Abstract Current JSON-RPC**

- Keep JSON-RPC but abstract the transport
- Generate TypeScript/Rust types from Go structs using `typeshare` or similar
- Add OpenAPI spec alongside existing implementation

**Phase 2: Add Network Support**

- Implement HTTP transport alongside Unix sockets
- Use same handler interface
- Add SSE for events over HTTP

**Phase 3: Cloud Sync**

- Build cloud API that mirrors daemon API
- Implement sync protocol for daemon->cloud
- Add mode switching in daemon

**Phase 4: Full Cloud Mode**

- Allow cloud to be source of truth
- Implement cloud-native agent execution
- Keep local daemon as optional accelerator

### 7. Extensibility for Future Tool Calls

Design a plugin-like system for approval types:

```yaml
# approval-types/file-edit.yaml
type: file_edit
metadata:
  displayName: 'File Edit'
  requiredContext:
    - file_contents
  optionalContext:
    - syntax_tree
    - git_diff

visualization:
  component: 'FileEditDiff'
  capabilities:
    - inline_editing
    - syntax_highlighting
```

This allows you to add new approval types without changing core infrastructure.

## Concrete Recommendations

1. **Start with OpenAPI** for your existing endpoints, but keep JSON-RPC working in parallel initially
2. **Use code generation** for both server stubs and clients - this ensures consistency
3. **Implement SSE** for events - it's simpler than WebSockets and works everywhere
4. **Build the context enrichment layer** early - it'll pay dividends as you add more approval types
5. **Design for multi-transport** from the start - abstract your handlers from transport
6. **Use a message queue** (even in-memory) between daemon and sync layer for reliability

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or create a more detailed implementation example for a specific part?
