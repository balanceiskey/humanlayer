# Freestyle Cloud Development Environment - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Build a cloud-based development environment that allows users to launch VM instances with pre-configured development tools (Claude Code), sync their local git repos, and interact with remote development servers through a web interface.

## Priority Assessment & Implementation Order

### **HIGHEST VALUE: Phase 1 - Foundation Infrastructure (Priority 1)**

The core foundation that everything else depends on. Without this, nothing else can work.

#### 1.1 VM Snapshot Infrastructure (Critical Path - Priority 1A)

- **Value**: Enables all cloud functionality
- **Effort**: High (VM setup, Claude Code integration, daemon configuration)
- **Blocking**: Everything depends on this
- **Implementation Priority**: **#1 - IMPLEMENT FIRST**

#### 1.2 HL Cloud API Core (Critical Path - Priority 1B)

- **Value**: Core backend functionality
- **Effort**: Medium-High (API design, VM provisioning, event streaming)
- **Blocking**: WUI and VM integration depend on this
- **Implementation Priority**: **#2 - IMPLEMENT SECOND**

#### 1.3 Web UI Core (Priority 1C)

- **Value**: User interface for launching dev environments
- **Effort**: Medium (React/Vue frontend, git integration, launch workflow)
- **Blocking**: User interaction depends on this
- **Implementation Priority**: **#3 - IMPLEMENT THIRD**

### **HIGH VALUE: Phase 2 - Integration (Priority 2)**

Connects all the components together for a working system.

#### 2.1 Git Workflow Integration (Priority 2A)

- **Value**: Essential for code synchronization
- **Effort**: Medium (git operations, authentication, error handling)
- **Implementation Priority**: **#4**

#### 2.2 VM Lifecycle Management (Priority 2B)

- **Value**: VM startup and daemon connectivity
- **Effort**: Medium (daemon startup, registration, initialization)
- **Implementation Priority**: **#5**

#### 2.3 Real-time Communication (Priority 2C)

- **Value**: Live status updates and event streaming
- **Effort**: Medium-High (WebSocket/SSE, event storage, reconnection)
- **Implementation Priority**: **#6**

### **MEDIUM VALUE: Phase 3 - Enhancement (Priority 3)**

Improves reliability and user experience.

#### 3.1 Advanced VM Features (Priority 3A)

- **Value**: Better VM control and process management
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Implementation Priority**: **#7**

#### 3.2 Development Server Management (Priority 3B)

- **Value**: Service discovery, health checks, log aggregation
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Implementation Priority**: **#8**

### **LOW VALUE: Phase 4 - Future Considerations (Priority 4)**

Nice-to-have features that can be added later.

## **SELECTED FOR IMPLEMENTATION: VM Snapshot Infrastructure (1.1)**

**Rationale**: This is the highest-value, most critical component that blocks all other development. It's the foundation that everything else builds upon.

**Components to Implement**:

1. Base VM image creation with Ubuntu/Debian
2. Claude Code installation and configuration
3. HL daemon installation and service configuration
4. VM snapshot creation and versioning
5. Snapshot deployment automation
6. Connection to HL Cloud API on daemon startup
7. Service management and health monitoring

**Success Criteria**:

- VM snapshot boots reliably
- Claude Code starts and is accessible
- HL daemon connects to cloud API automatically
- System daemon manages services properly
- Snapshot can be forked for new instances

## Implementation Strategy

- Use **up to 500 subagents** for parallel development
- Create CLEANROOM specifications for each component
- Implement core VM infrastructure first
- Build comprehensive testing and validation
- Document all APIs and interfaces
