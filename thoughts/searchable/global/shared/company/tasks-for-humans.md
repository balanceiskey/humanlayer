# HumanLayer Tasks for Humans

_This file manages tasks that need to be delegated to humans because they cannot be accomplished through code and automation. Use sparingly and archive completed tasks regularly._

## Guidelines

- Only use for tasks that ABSOLUTELY cannot be automated
- Tasks should enable automation - no task should be delegated twice, for example, instead of asking for an action in a web app, ask for an api token to that web app (with detailed instructions!)
- Include clear deadlines and ownership
- Update status regularly
- Archive completed tasks to tasks-for-humans-archive.md
- Keep active list focused and manageable
