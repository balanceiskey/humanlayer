    <p> Hey folks - internal investor update below. </p>

    <p> Fun detail - this email brought to you via gmail APIs and claude code in the thoughts repo!</p>

    <p>For better or for worse, this world keeps moving faster and faster.</p>

    <h4>Company Numbers</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>MRR: $1000 (-$500)</li>
        <li>Customers: 2 (-1)</li>
        <li>Cash: $2.3m</li>
        <li>Monthly Burn: $45k</li>
        <li>Runway: 59 months</li>
        <li>Team: Founder + 2 full time engineers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Founders Essay</h4>

    <p>Not a ton of product udpates here, we've been heads down on a number of experiments lately, doing some customer
        discover on a few different directions we could take. At the end of the day, SDKs that wrap slack/email APIs may
        not be a broad enough solution for what real buyers need. We can get a lot of energy and attention from indie
        devs, but serious builders weren't responding. At the beginning of last month, the plan was to explore the "turn
        your MCPs into an email address you can delegate to" angle, but have since decided to focus instead. We're still
        in early stages, but we think we can build a great product for managing many coding agents in parallel.</p>

    <p>This is an incredibly competitive market, and in many ways this direction would be the biggest swing we've taken
        to date. It would position us to compete with Devin, Vibe Kanban, and even Cursor soon. I'm excited to see how
        much we've been firing on all cylinders since deciding to explore this. I'll continue to update y'all with my
        competitive thesis on the space as it evolves, and why the future of software work needs new tools, new UX
        paradigms, and a new approach to human/agent collaboration.</p>

    <p>Theres a few strong GTM angles we're exploring, from the bottom-up dev-first workflow, as well as more top down
        like "approach CTOs and ask if they want help making their team more ai-native in development". We've got a
        waitlist at https://hlyr.dev/code, and since mentioning it offhand to a few founders 2 weeks ago, we have 20+
        organic inbound just by word of mouth from people who want to try things out. My 2-week goal is to get 100
        waitlist signups and get live hands-on product feedback from at least 20 of them.</p>

    <p>What about 12 factor agents? At the risk of losing focus, we are still keeping a finger on the general
        conversation around agent architecture and how to build great agents. Being an authority on great agents gets us
        two things</p>

    <ol>
        <li>General distribution - I can book meetings I couldn't have before, and I get lots more inbound interest than
            previously - many of the 4k stars on the github repo converted</li>
        <li>Sales process acceleration - some signals that having a high-quality resource out there makes it much easier
            for</li>
        <li>Broader vision alignment - our big picture vision is to build tools that help agents scale humans, not
            replace that, which means building great platforms and UIs for a single person to manage 10s or 100s of
            agents asynchronously. Both the current coding focus and a broader "superhuman for agents" angle.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Fun highlight - the term Context Engineering, (which we wrote about back in april in 12fa) is getting a ton of
        traction including from Tobi of Shopify, Swyx, Harrison Chase, the folks behind Devin, and others. Short
        highlight here - https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-06-25-context-eng.</p>

    <p>Thanks as always for your support as we traverse this quickly evolving AI landscape - some cooler, more concrete
        updates coming your way next month. We're still keeping burn low and staying lean, but by no means complacent in
        the face of less-than-ideal growth numbers.</p>

    <h4>How you can help</h4>

    <p>We're starting to source eyes for a new prototype we're exploring (see below). On the lookout for CTOs/VPEs who
        have an initiative to educate/empower/enable their teams to do more AI-assisted coding. Teaser and waitlist
