### Friday 2025-06-20

So this week we're pretty much all in on coding assistant stuff. So we picked up some stuff with doing the WUI and making the WebUI. There is a lot of work done to try to wrap up and consolidate all of the architecture documentation for changing the daemon from being like a local over a socket to a JSON RPC S and C thing that will support all four levels of our cloud architecture. We've got tons of new features in the Towery app, WebUI, approvals are coming along, rejections, interruption, all kinds of really fancy stuff. So all product, all product this week. That's pretty much it. We're getting ready to do a soft launch to a bunch of the best five coders in the world.

1. Sales
   1. **Symetra \-** Jason’s about to be on vacation but he’s down to spin something up when he’s back
   2. **GraniteRock** \- deep dive call friday
   3. **Two Sigma** \- working on intro to [Sushil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushil-trivedi-38712738/)
   4. **PandaDoc** \- phil would be interested to try the new thing Quotes:
      1. I think you might be onto something here, this is definitely a different angle. Everyone’s always looking at “well how’s the data being used, you know \- what tables are the most active, why is your lineage \*\*\*\*, all this kind of stuff. But coming in from the other side saying “this is how users are using the data, and this is where the users could be more efficient” \- it still answers the same underlying question, but it just presents it in a different way.
      2. "I think you're really onto something here. This definitely takes a different angle. Everyone's usually focused on questions like 'How's the data being used?', 'Which tables are the most active?', and 'Why is your lineage problematic?'. But approaching it from the perspective of 'This is how users are interacting with the data and where they could be more efficient' still addresses the same core issues, just in a very different way."
2. Engineering and product
   1. Building out internal dog-food pipeline for DBT and auto-labeling tables
   2. Touch point w/ Snowflake Apps team to get unblocked on a few things \- goal is to get native app ready for private offer this week.
3. Marketing
   1. Spinning up live podcast-y conversation work, scheduled conversations with data folks from Deutsche Telekom, Clari, and more

### Jun 7, 2024

1. Spent the week at snowflake conference
   1. Hosted a small seated dinner w/ prospects and a handful of partners/influencers (thanks again to Preface Ventures for sponsoring\!)

      7. Grabbed drinks w/ Phil Warner @ Pandadoc (prospect)
   3. Other solid partner-y conversations with influential folks in the community
      1. Connected w/ Snowflake Product leadership on Snowpark / Marketplace stuff
         1. Interesting insight here is they’re very invested in ISVs \- they’re more interested in Snowpark for ecosystem/marketplace than for first-party deployments

### April Update \- Long

Hi folks,

- In procurement / contracting steps with a Series C devtools company (\~125 employees, YC ‘18)
- Continuing to work discovery with another Series C SaaS co, need to ship Redshift support before we get plugged in seriously
- Continuing to build relationships with key players at two other larger prospects (100m+ revenue orgs)
- Initial conversation with G500 Telco was promising (quote below)
- A few other smaller opportunities continuing to move

**Product**

- A lot of our product work has been polish and refinement to fix some longer-tail parsing problems. [Filed our first issue with SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/issues/3318), which the team promptly fixed.
- We’ve completed some important infrastructure hardening / reliability milestones that both improve UX of our product, and keep our options open in terms of the analytics/query layer (currently using Neo4j, but can now easily flex to DuckDB and other options)
- We’ve delivered the first version of a BigQuery cost analytics view, our first foray into the “control spend” use case

- Completed prototype of a more-agentic GenAI workflow involving prompt-chaining a few different workflows to describe stakeholder activity. This represents a significant step from “tools a data engineer might use” toward the “service as a software” of automating the work of a data engineer. Below is an example summary based on my activity building cumulative flow tables from our project tracking data.

- Built out initial scaffolding for RedShift support, which lets us start conversations with a few other prospects currently waiting for it

**Marketing**

- Market \- digging into [Euno](https://euno.ai/) and [Datalogz](https://www.datalogz.io/) as both validation that there’s a need here, and also potentially competitive tool sets
- Lead Gen \- Linkedin continues to be a solid source of inbound leads. By hopping into “violent agreement” on relevant linkedin threads, able to draw attention from data leaders that buy into the vision, some of which convert to waitlist signups. Waitlist \-\> Demo Call conversion was 2 for 2 last month, including data leader from that G500 telco

**Operations**

- Have enthusiastic engagement from two initial hires, both of whom we’ve worked with before and are consistently asking “hey when can we get started”
- **Closing Thoughts**
  A few quotes that continue to convince me that we’re onto something big here \-

\> The industry needs more tools and content around analytics from a product owner role
– Data product manager running modernization/centralization at G500 Telco, grew data team from 5 to 100 in a few years

\> If you can figure out how to reliably keep data leaders informed about the business value they’re delivering, you’re going to make a lot of money.
 – CEO @ YC 21 Analytics Co

\> One of the best things you can do as a CDO is to clearly articulate your team’s role as a dependency of the most important things the company wants to get done. It becomes abundantly clear why you need funding, what you’re going to do, and why
– Jason Ash, CDO @ Symmetra (80-person data org, 2000-employees total)

### Apr 19, 2024

9. Sales
   1. Replit pricing call on 4/15, working to iron out the details. Logo permission will be hard but I will fight hard for it. Lindsay was on vacation for the rest of the week so I need to get that nailed down next week.
      1. Good call w/ tom \- getting closer to full fidelity on the queries in-app
   2. Lightbank folks worked on an intro to Eric at Numerator \- sounds like he talked to some folks on the team (Jared, etc) but the takeaway was that they weren’t “ready for it” because they “just got onto dbt” \- something must have crossed wires there because the angle we pitched them is “we’ll help you implement DBT faster”
   3. PandaDoc slowing down, seems to be competing priorities there
   4. Kicked off security review at Replicated this week
   5. Had an initial call w/ Sean @ prefect \- due to SOC II, it’s a little tricky to just spin up a random SaaS trial, but we could try to swing the on-prem angle.
10. Engineering and product

    1. First full graph database rebuild from raw data \- confirmed we can do this, plus we’re now starting fresh with a smaller and more targeted dataset (excluding a ton of fivetran noise, which could be up to 75% of traffic on a given day)
    2. Completed scheduling work for keeping GCP data up to date and finalized incremental and targeted backfill capabilities
    3. Extensive work to debug long tail of unparseable queries. We won’t get to 100% but we might get close.
    4. Delivered initial draft of GCP cost data view

11. Marketing
    1. Continued success in linkedin engagement, leads from
       1. Data PM @ Deutsche Telekom (signed up for waitlist, scheduled call on 4/18)
          1. Good initial call, but I know this will be a long journey here [Dennis (Deutsche Telekom) / Dex Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17a_zf929D_G_Yi5hPSiQ9D91cWiv2Hh5-eHExjd9Xag/edit)
       2. Data Scientist @ Trinet \- connect in Austin
       3. Data Scientist @ Klaviyo \- boston-based
12. Operations
    1. Kicked off pre-seed raise, now at 700 in hand / 730 committed / 1.2m target
    2. Timing goal is flexible so we can optimize for value-add angels rather than just pad with a bigger check from a fund who’s gonna be mostly hands off (although we have that option)
    3. Finalizing model for 1.2m raise \- keeping things pretty lean
       1. Targeting 1.5-2 engineering hires in june (potential for contract-to-hire on one), plus 5 hr/week from an operations advisor
       2. Budgeting 15k/month per FTE, Plus another \~8k/month across cloud, tooling, legal, travel, office expenses, etc.
       3. Another engineering hire targeted for August, can pull forward or push back depending on need / how fast we’re growing
       4. Targeting 18 months of runway (if we close zero revenue, closer to 15 months)
    4. Still working with
       1. Wes McKinney, Composed.vc (min 1% allocation \- 80k+)
       2. Invest In Data \- IID, usually smaller 200-300k checks from strategics (e.g. I got a ping from docsend that a data people from US bank, Klayvio, watched one of our videos last week). They would probably need until mid-may to decide.
       3. Boldstart \- partner call on Monday 4/22 \- this is probably the only institutional fund I’d let in for a full 500-750k
       4. A number of other angels on the radar, incl Benn Stancil, Barry McCardel, Jason Ash, still in the mix, have a longer list where I’m digging for intros
       5. New Stack \- they typically target at 10% allocation, but have room for an “off thesis” check in the 200-300k range, fairly hands off
       6. Lightbank \- Can tap into this one as well if we’re interested, would probably be similarly hands-off
       7. Heavybit \- first meeting was great, second was a bit of a whiff, will be interested to see where that goes. My feeling is if they get in, it will be post-close with a discount note for the next round.
    5. Hiring \- chatting w/ some folks that both Ravi and I have worked with before
       1. 3 hour conversation w/ candidate for first design/product hire on wednesday, went very well, would need to figure out some details WRT timing and fractional vs. full-time
       2. Long in-person chat w/ candidate for first full-stack engineer and potential future VPE on thursday, lot of interest there as well
