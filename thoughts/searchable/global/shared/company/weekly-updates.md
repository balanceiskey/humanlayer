### Friday 2025-06-20

So this week we're pretty much all in on coding assistant stuff. So we picked up some stuff with doing the WUI and making the WebUI. There is a lot of work done to try to wrap up and consolidate all of the architecture documentation for changing the daemon from being like a local over a socket to a JSON RPC S and C thing that will support all four levels of our cloud architecture. We've got tons of new features in the Towery app, WebUI, approvals are coming along, rejections, interruption, all kinds of really fancy stuff. So all product, all product this week. That's pretty much it. We're getting ready to do a soft launch to a bunch of the best five coders in the world.

### End of May Update

Slightly delayed update here \- had the incredible opportunity to speak on stage at the AI Engineer World’s Fair to a packed house last wednesday on 12 factor agents, which took a lot of last week’s focus and attention.

### End of February Update

Short update \- team growing, velocity picking up, lot more bandwidth toward building prospect pipeline in March.

**Company Numbers**

- MRR: $1500 (+$0)
- Customers: 3 (+0)
- Commercial Prospects: 13 (+1)
- Cash: $2.6m
- Monthly Burn: $50k
- Runway: 4+ years

**How You Can Help**

Biggest priority is building pipeline \- a new GTM angle that’s landing well (based on success of our friends at mandel.ai from YC S23) is “the Human-in-the-Loop over email goes a long way to getting enterprises to trust AI that does real, impactful, valuable work”.

So my current ICP I’m testing is “Series-A AI company, looking to drive bigger/faster enterprise trust/adoption”.

Exploring the same for working with innovators _inside_ the enterprise that are building “first-party” AI agents.

If you know folks that fit the bill, send ‘em over\!

**Team Updates**

- HumanLayer is growing \- a lot of February was onboarding two full-time 1099 contractors to give us some extra velocity, shouts out to Dan and Sundeep who have already contributed massively\!

**Company Numbers**

- MRR: $1500 (+0)

**How You Can Help**

We want to help forward-thinking startups build awesome stuff with AI. These days I’m iterating heavily on reference architectures for AI Agents, because building agentic workflows into existing apps is a pretty tangled mess, and there’s a lot of weird advice out there. If you know teams that are looking to quickly evolve their SaaS product into an AI agent, I’d love an intro.

**Founder’s Essay**

We’re sitting on a good amount of cash but pretty tapped out keeping up with the tech needs of our current customers. Good problems to have but problems nonetheless. As you might imagine, we’re pouring a ton of time into hiring and interviewing founding engineers / eng leaders. I’d say I have talked to 15-20 people, done a ton of second and third round interviews, and have some folks starting on 1099 trials late jan / early feb that I’m super stoked about.

Even with a ton of effort spent there, we also shipped quite a few very cool features in the last month, and since December, stoked to share that we are now powering several customer workloads in production. Among a handful of smaller updates, we delivered

- Custom domain whitelabeling for email operations
- Email customization with jinja templates
- Improvements to webhook format and delivery
- API updates to enable human review for LLM classifier workflows

Looking forward, we’re continuing to evolve our thesis on state-of-the-art in AI Agent Architectures. I’ve soft-published the first version of our linear assistant, one of the AI automations we’re using to help run the company. It’s at [https://github.com/got-agents/agents](https://github.com/got-agents/agents), and essentially it’s a “chief of staff” agent that can receive emails about various tasks and jobs to complete, and turn those into structured API calls. As I keep saying (partial credit to Rajal Patel @ Flex on this one) “we keep trying to get AI to do all these deeply technical things like writing code and analyzing data. But what they’re probably gonna be really great at is summarizing what’s going on, and moving context around the organization.”

We’ll continue to build cool stuff here, and work on evangelize what we’re calling “12 factor agents” \- a new standard for AI application architecture that is framework-agnostic and opens the door to more teams who want to “do agent-y things” without needing to buy into one of the opinionated frameworks. Put another way \- [An Agent is a foldL where the reducer is an LLM call](https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/1876041009630728469)

Between building, hiring, strategy, and kicking off SOC2 this month, outbound go-to-market has taken a bit of a back seat, however, inbound interest has still been strong. With a little bit of follow up, we were able to add a couple solid opptys just this last week. As new team members get ramped up I’m excited to get back into growth mode.

That’s all we got right now \- short one this month. Stay tuned for some big drops in Feb

- Customers: 0 (-1)
- Commercial Prospects: 6 (+2)
  - (Monzo, Fume, Max AI, Synth, Rockstar, Teammates.work)
- Cash: $1.2m

**How you can help**

We’ll be launching on Product Hunt in the next week or so, please keep an eye out for a note and drop us an upvote (you [need to create an account](https://www.google.com/search?q=product+hunt+sign+up&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) a few days in advance to vote, now’s a great oppty to do so\!).

Other than that, still looking for intros to great founding engineers w/ upside to CTO/Cofounder \- snippet below in case you think of anyone \- thank you\!

_Any interest in talking to [Dex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterihorthy/)? He started a company solo and was accepted to YCombinator for this new Fall batch (starts this week). He moved to SF in September and is looking to meet great folks who could refer a possible additional technical co-founder. I've always appreciated your technical chops and network, so I thought you might be open to meeting him._

**Founder’s Essay**
The headline in my eyes is the EU AI Act, specifically [Article 14](https://www.euaiact.com/article/14) \- which describes what I see as a potential interesting opportunity, testing this week.

_Human oversight shall aim to prevent or minimise the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse_

The last 6 weeks have been a bit of a whirlwind, the main focuses have been:

\- 2 weeks deep on cofounder search \- have a few leads but nothing I want to rush out right now, so that’s more passive at this point
\- 2 weeks focusing heavily on outbound sales \- this got us some conversations but didn’t feel like a great ROI on our time
\- 2 weeks focusing a lot on marketing, see if we can get people to come to us

Just wrapped that last two weeks. Going to review but my instinct is that getting this kind of stuff in front of lots of people and driving inbound is super valuable (see “virtual teammates” below)

Some accomplishments I’m proud of

- Reworked entire billing system to be credits-based and pay-as-you-go
- Launched on YC, got a ton of interesting inbound
- Sponsored the AI Tinkerers Humans-in-the-Loop hackathon, gave a strong demo in front of \~100 practitioners, got in the trenches w/ some really good feedback from a bunch of sophisticated users.
  - The finalists included showcases of some very cool HumanLayer implementations \-

During this time, we ended up firing a customer. We had done a “things that don’t scale” type operation where we built+hosted an agent for him. I had the conversation around “we could continue to maintain this but I need to charge more than $100/mo”. We kinda mutually decided it wasn’t driving enough value, so glad to have that off our plate so we can focus on what is evolving as a much more narrow picture of a short-term ICP:

1. “Virtual Teammates” companies \- most of these tend to have a hacked-up version of human layer for unsticking agents. Unclear if we can get them to switch, but good signal that they need this, and we generally get a “if we knew you guys existed I would have rather used this”
2. Internal AI engineer at large enterprise looking to evangelize and deploy agents internally, mostly for back office / IT automations
3. Could narrow to some subset of 1 and/or 2 that are affected by the EU AI Act \- testing some outbound on that this week.

Some goals:

1. Launch on Product hunt
2. Ship some new email-based agent features and demos
3. Close 1-2 accounts at something like $500/mo

### End of September Update Sep 30, 2024

Hi folks \- Dex here, coming at you live from the new HumanLayer HQ in San Francisco as we get ready to plug in for YC's Fall 24 batch\!

**Company Numbers**

_Numbers below include the incoming $500k from the YC standard deal, which is technically still in the docs process._

- September Revenue: $98 (+$0)
- Customers: 1 (+0)
- Commercial Prospects: 3 (+0)
- Cash: $1.2m
- Monthly Burn: $22k
- Runway: 4+ years

**How you can help**

Priority \#1 right now is finding a technical cofounder. I know y’all all have stellar networks, here’s a snippet in case it helps.

_Any interest in talking to [Dex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterihorthy/)? He started a company solo and was accepted to YCombinator for this new Fall batch (starts this week). He moved to SF this week and is looking to meet great folks who could refer a possible additional technical co-founder. I've always appreciated your technical chops and network, so I thought you might be open to meeting him._

**Founder’s Essay**

I’m beyond stoked about kicking off YC today, can’t wait to get in the trenches with some of the best founders in the world. This will probably be a shorter update.

On the customer development side, we’ve had \~20 conversations this month, with a few converting to second calls and potential commercial use cases. I’m working on kicking off another round of outbound next week, focusing more on technical leaders, engineers, and CTOs, as opposed to the previous campaign’s focus on AI Product Managers. Looking forward to comparing/contrasting the differences there. Outbound is still primarily focused on companies w/ 50+ employees, to eliminate noise from smaller founder-CTOs who may have an incentive to play with new tools even if there’s no commercial angle.

In that time we’ve uncovered some problems w/ customers for things that _are_ human in the loop, but not quite aligned with the current product direction. For example, I had a call with a team building an Executive Assistant that works over email, and they had a need for a more traditional RLHF with manual labeling \+ regular re-tuning of model weights, for very specific tasks (not agentic/tool-calling). They do this once a quarter because even outside the human labeling, things are quite manual. They’d like to do this weekly, and it sounds like there’s a product gap in the market here (although I haven’t done the research to confirm).

I’m starting to get some light confirmation on another hypothesis that surface in July/August \- once you help someone build a great agent using HumanLayer, the next question is almost always “how/where do I run this”. We’ve experimented with a few options, including fly.io and some other container-based platforms, and haven’t found the right angle. Obviously if someone has AWS+EKS+etc, running yet another container is not a problem, but a lot of folks who want to harness the power of agents don’t have this. So I’m continuing to explore on the side: what might it look like to build a PaaS for agents? Some early prototypes coming together there.

Thanks as always to everyone, old and new, who’s cheering us on\! Here’s to a highly productive next few months 💪

**Product Highlights**

It's been a crazy two weeks moving across the country, but we didn't let that stop us from continuing to build awesome things with our community \- a few highlights:

\- We were live in person at the [AI Tinkerers Hackathon in Seattle](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ulib_and-the-winners-are-incredible-activity-7245054524204204032-soa9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), where 80+ world-class AI engineers joined to build Human-in-the-Loop tools, competing for 14k+ in prizes and credits.
\- New feature, developed in collaboration with one of the hackathon teams \- [Automated Slack Blocks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dexterihorthy_very-stoked-about-this-humanlayer-yc-f24-activity-7245497456577150977-yYwU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
\- New starter guide for [using HumanLayer with Anthropic](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/examples/langchain-anthropic/04-linkedin-anthropic.py#L121-L151)
\- Previously, agent usage of the HumanLayer API was tracked at the Project/Company level. We’ve rebuilt how API token authentication works in the HumanLayer API to give us user-level insights into usage and adoption metrics. With any luck, my next update will have some more fine-grained insights on adoption and overall usage.

### End of August Monthly Update

It’s been a wild month officially pivoting to HumanLayer, launching at AI Tinkerers in San Francisco, and kicking off a ton of customer development. Just dropped our [Latest product update on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dexterihorthy_aiagents-humanintheloop-activity-7235301250165043201-u1BK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), give us a boost if you can\!

Two big announcements \- **closed our first revenue** from a solopreneur who’s using HumanLayer to automate lead generation for his technical content marketing agency, starting at $98 MRR but I believe there’s room to grow here. Second, I think you all know this, but I’m officially **headed out to San Francisco** to build this thing with the world-class AI community there. I’ll be based in SF starting September 24th.

**Company Numbers**

- August Revenue: $98 (+$98)
- Customers: 1 (+1)
- Commercial Prospects: 3 (+3)
- Cash: $570k
- Monthly Burn: $20k
- Runway: 28 months

**Founder’s Essay**

It’s been a wild month, and I’m definitely feeling the pull for the new direction I’ve been exploring. The AI engineering community is vibrant and highly productive these days.

However, I’m still keeping an eye on the fact that most of our users and testers are smaller teams, either CTOs of \<10p startups, or tinkers, or agencies building custom agents.. We’ve yet to vet out this product at the more commercial layer, and have started some dedicated outbound to AI Product Managers at 40+ person companies to try to get a feel for how this fits into the buying equations for larger teams who might feasibly spend spend 10-25k annually.

The more I think about things, the more I am thinking that HumanLayer is probably just chapter 1 of this whole equation. I don’t see this thing selling at the enterprise tier for 6-figure contracts, it probably caps out around 25k or al little above. In light of that, I’m spending all my spare cycles designing out what I think could be a great chapter 2\. This is more in the AI Agent Orchestration space, and solving a lot of the problems that have been overlooked in the most popular tools like LangChain, CrewAI, even more modern approaches like LangGraph. The good news is that if HumanLayer catches on, the workflows it gives folks will call for a next-gen orchestration framework, and I think there’s massive enterprise value in building “the kubernetes of AI”

That said, the interest in chapter 1 is there, the community is excited about HumanLayer. Even as I keep eyes on the longer-term bigger picture, we’ll also keep leaning into that energy and momentum around the core product and continuing to see what the potential is there.

Deeply grateful to you and to everyone else who’s been rooting for us. 1.2k ARR in the bank, here’s to the next 50k\!

Dex

### And Now for Something Completely Different \- Mid August Update

###

**HumanLayer Pre-Launch**
_(for people I met post-metalytics)_

Hi\! Stoked to share that we’ll be launching HumanLayer TONIGHT, on Wednesday August 21, at [AI Tinkerers](https://sf.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-san-francisco-august-2024-meetup) in San Francisco.

As a refresher, [HumanLayer](https://humanlayer.dev) is an AI productivity platform which brings human interaction and human approval to asynchronous and outer-loop agents. It’s deeply rooted in the idea that the next generation of AI agents will call for an inversion of control \- rather than humans consulting AI in e.g. a chat workflow, AI will be reaching out to humans as needed for input, feedback, and approvals.

1. Progress
   1. Started interviewing potential users July 22, started building this experiment July 30th
   2. I’ve built an MVP, done 6 demos w/ technical users so far, and have a few enthusiastic design partner candidates lined up
   3. Will be presenting at [AI Tinkerers San Francisco](https://sf.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-san-francisco-august-2024-meetup) on 8/21, and [AI Tinkerers NYC](https://nyc.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-august-meetup) on 8/26, and beyond

   2. We’ll be launching on HackerNews on Wednesday \- if you want to help by giving us an upvote, reply to this email and I’ll send you a note on Wednesday
   3. If you’ve played with agents and tool-calling, and want to give HumanLayer a spin, [grab some time](https://calendar.app.google/3XfZW6A34SbRhkDA6) and I’ll get you onboarded.
   4. If you know AI Engineers or AI Product Managers who are struggling to ship high-quality AI products or scale the “vibe check” in AI, reply to this email and let’s figure out an intro (or feel free to forward this along)
   5. I’m **currently on the lookout for a strong founding engineer** \- if you know great, scrappy engineers who’ve always wanted to do the startup thing \- let’s talk

Thanks especially to our early contractors and advisors, our investors who continue to believe in us, our design partners going deep with us to explore potential product angles, and to everyone out there who’s given us energy in the last nine months \- your intros, advice, brainstorming and general support make a huge difference, and I can’t wait to show you what’s next.

**From Metalytics to HumanLayer**

howdy \- I know at some point we chatted about Metalytics, wanted to update you on the latest direction

We still believe strongly that the data industry needs better tools for understanding the value and impact of data work, but in the short term, we’re exploring a new angle \- **HumanLayer**

[HumanLayer](https://humanlayer.dev) is an AI productivity platform which brings human interaction and human approval to asynchronous and outer-loop agents.

### June 2024 Update

**Company**
$613k in the bank, $26k/mo burn, 17mo of runway, 7 active prospects, new ones include DBT, GraniteRock, and Mux

**Sales and Marketing**
Had a good showing at the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco, connecting face-to-face with existing prospects and finding a handful of new ones. Hosted a small dinner w/ a few prospects, founders, and other folks from the data community (thanks to Preface Ventures for sponsoring 💪). Had good conversations w/ founders of Dagster and Tobiko data around co-marketing for our recently open-sourced [Open Data Products](https://github.com/open-data-products/odp) tool.

Compared to May, we did far fewer investor/advisor meetings, more prospect meetings, and spent more time on product \- in July, **aiming to hit 20+ customer calls** and **add 5-10 new opps to the pipeline**. By end of July, we hope to have 3 active product evaluations (part of this is waiting on marketplace security review from Snowflake team, which is supposed to take about a month right now).

**Product**
We spent a lot of June gathering feedback and talking to prospects about a few new prototypes, including the [“Data Impact Report” on the website](https://metalytics.dev), as well as some more stripped-down versions of the core Metalytics web app suitable for deployment via the Snowflake marketplace. We have found some strong signal that deploying via the snowflake marketplace will help us to overcome some of the security/activation energy hurdles with larger prospects. Case in point: a large prospect (2000+ employees, \~150m revenue) said they would be excited to do an evaluation if we can deliver our app in this way.

Our product is evolving based on a lot of feedback to be simpler and to enable async/autonomous notification-driven workflows (where users don’t need to log into the tool to get value from it). They connect their systems and then it starts pushing insights to slack, github, and ticketing systems.

Longer term, Metalytics will progress from detection/notification to resolving problems automatically, becoming an autonomous data engineer. We’re starting with simple tasks like deprecating unused workloads, and evolving to more complex tasks like creating and evolving data models in systems like DBT, LookML, and more. A few previews below, with a deeper focus on “just what’s actionable” and some exploration of a more single-stream, chat-focused interface.

We’re excited to get a video demo of this stuff together in the next couple of weeks.

   2. **GraniteRock** \- deep dive call friday

   4. **PandaDoc** \- phil would be interested to try the new thing Quotes:
      1. I think you might be onto something here, this is definitely a different angle. Everyone’s always looking at “well how’s the data being used, you know \- what tables are the most active, why is your lineage \*\*\*\*, all this kind of stuff. But coming in from the other side saying “this is how users are using the data, and this is where the users could be more efficient” \- it still answers the same underlying question, but it just presents it in a different way.
      2. "I think you're really onto something here. This definitely takes a different angle. Everyone's usually focused on questions like 'How's the data being used?', 'Which tables are the most active?', and 'Why is your lineage problematic?'. But approaching it from the perspective of 'This is how users are interacting with the data and where they could be more efficient' still addresses the same core issues, just in a very different way."
2. Engineering and product
   1. Building out internal dog-food pipeline for DBT and auto-labeling tables
   2. Touch point w/ Snowflake Apps team to get unblocked on a few things \- goal is to get native app ready for private offer this week.

### May Update \- Short

Hi folks \- for most of y’all getting this, you already have most of the details, but here’s the latest \- let me know what I missed

- Biggest update here is that we’re taking a step back to focus on updating our Persona and Promise \- selling more directly to data leaders, and business leaders who own the bill for a centralized data function (CTO, VPE, CEO, CFO) \- prototypes making it onto the website at [https://metalytics.dev](https://metalytics.dev).
  - This is in part due to the fact that our most promising design partner pulled out for the foreseeable future
- Doing some pipeline rebuild to test this new hypothesis / product direction. This week we’re at the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco doing some heavy prospecting (June 3-6)
- Have a very promising potential advisor in [Philip Zelitchenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipzelichenko/) (ZoomInfo). Philip believes strongly in our vision and that in 5-10 years a tool like Metalytics will be core to how every business does data – In [a deep dive with Tom Tunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/managing-data-as-product/), Philip describes a similar tool they built internally at ZoomInfo
- Deprioritizing remainder of fundraise to try to get some more milestones WRT this new product direction. That means we get to hold the remaining 250-450k for serious value-add angels as we build momentum \+ social proof for a proper seed round in \~12 months.
- Starting July 1 we’ll reduce burn from $35k/mo to $26k/mo, keeping us at 20 months of runway

### April Update \- Short

Booked Investor Email List: Farooq, Aaron, Grant Miller, Marc Campbell, Ravi, Sundeep, Matt, Austin A, Taylor, Emilie, Austin O

Hi folks, quick update here \-

- In procurement / contracting steps with a Series C devtools company (\~125 employees, YC 18\)
- 5 engaged prospects from 50-2000 employees still in the pre-eval stage, progressing. Promising first conversation w/ a G500 telco last week.
- Shipped cost management, first agentic GenAI workflow, and a lot of UX/performance updates this month. Kicking off Redshift work this week which unlocks several new prospect conversations
- Started fundraising officially 2 weeks ago, already at 750k out of the 1m we’re targeting
- Current Burn is \~$35k/mo, 20 months of runway today
- Well underway lining up first 2 product/engineering hires
- Ext \- Here’s our latest [Deck](https://docsend.com/view/yivmqk9c37xwztac) and [Demo](https://docsend.com/view/ngpk6kqdpv7aiyex)

We’re on to something big here

\> Before, prepping for this Monday meeting would have taken me hours. I would have had to send a bunch of slack messages, hop on some zoom calls, but y’all just saw me do it \- it took a few minutes in Metalytics and I now have 80% of the context I need.
 – Senior Data Engineer actively using the product 3-5x per week

\> If you can figure out how to enable data leaders to quantify the business value they’re delivering, you’re going to make a lot of money.
 – CEO @ YC 21 Analytics Company

\> One of the best things you can do as a CDO is to clearly articulate your team’s role as a dependency of the most important things the company wants to get done. It becomes abundantly clear why you need funding, what you’re going to do, and why

### April Update \- Long

Hi folks,

- In procurement / contracting steps with a Series C devtools company (\~125 employees, YC ‘18)
- Continuing to work discovery with another Series C SaaS co, need to ship Redshift support before we get plugged in seriously
- Continuing to build relationships with key players at two other larger prospects (100m+ revenue orgs)
- Initial conversation with G500 Telco was promising (quote below)
- A few other smaller opportunities continuing to move

**Product**

- A lot of our product work has been polish and refinement to fix some longer-tail parsing problems. [Filed our first issue with SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/issues/3318), which the team promptly fixed.
- We’ve completed some important infrastructure hardening / reliability milestones that both improve UX of our product, and keep our options open in terms of the analytics/query layer (currently using Neo4j, but can now easily flex to DuckDB and other options)
- We’ve delivered the first version of a BigQuery cost analytics view, our first foray into the “control spend” use case

- Completed prototype of a more-agentic GenAI workflow involving prompt-chaining a few different workflows to describe stakeholder activity. This represents a significant step from “tools a data engineer might use” toward the “service as a software” of automating the work of a data engineer. Below is an example summary based on my activity building cumulative flow tables from our project tracking data.

- Built out initial scaffolding for RedShift support, which lets us start conversations with a few other prospects currently waiting for it

**Marketing**

- Market \- digging into [Euno](https://euno.ai/) and [Datalogz](https://www.datalogz.io/) as both validation that there’s a need here, and also potentially competitive tool sets
- Lead Gen \- Linkedin continues to be a solid source of inbound leads. By hopping into “violent agreement” on relevant linkedin threads, able to draw attention from data leaders that buy into the vision, some of which convert to waitlist signups. Waitlist \-\> Demo Call conversion was 2 for 2 last month, including data leader from that G500 telco

**Operations**

- Have enthusiastic engagement from two initial hires, both of whom we’ve worked with before and are consistently asking “hey when can we get started”
- **Closing Thoughts**
  A few quotes that continue to convince me that we’re onto something big here \-

\> The industry needs more tools and content around analytics from a product owner role
– Data product manager running modernization/centralization at G500 Telco, grew data team from 5 to 100 in a few years

\> If you can figure out how to reliably keep data leaders informed about the business value they’re delivering, you’re going to make a lot of money.
 – CEO @ YC 21 Analytics Co

\> One of the best things you can do as a CDO is to clearly articulate your team’s role as a dependency of the most important things the company wants to get done. It becomes abundantly clear why you need funding, what you’re going to do, and why
– Jason Ash, CDO @ Symmetra (80-person data org, 2000-employees total)

### Apr 19, 2024

9. Sales
   1. Replit pricing call on 4/15, working to iron out the details. Logo permission will be hard but I will fight hard for it. Lindsay was on vacation for the rest of the week so I need to get that nailed down next week.
      1. Good call w/ tom \- getting closer to full fidelity on the queries in-app
   2. Lightbank folks worked on an intro to Eric at Numerator \- sounds like he talked to some folks on the team (Jared, etc) but the takeaway was that they weren’t “ready for it” because they “just got onto dbt” \- something must have crossed wires there because the angle we pitched them is “we’ll help you implement DBT faster”
   3. PandaDoc slowing down, seems to be competing priorities there
   4. Kicked off security review at Replicated this week
   5. Had an initial call w/ Sean @ prefect \- due to SOC II, it’s a little tricky to just spin up a random SaaS trial, but we could try to swing the on-prem angle.
10. Engineering and product

    1. First full graph database rebuild from raw data \- confirmed we can do this, plus we’re now starting fresh with a smaller and more targeted dataset (excluding a ton of fivetran noise, which could be up to 75% of traffic on a given day)
    2. Completed scheduling work for keeping GCP data up to date and finalized incremental and targeted backfill capabilities
    3. Extensive work to debug long tail of unparseable queries. We won’t get to 100% but we might get close.
    4. Delivered initial draft of GCP cost data view

11. Marketing
    1. Continued success in linkedin engagement, leads from
       1. Data PM @ Deutsche Telekom (signed up for waitlist, scheduled call on 4/18)
          1. Good initial call, but I know this will be a long journey here [Dennis (Deutsche Telekom) / Dex Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17a_zf929D_G_Yi5hPSiQ9D91cWiv2Hh5-eHExjd9Xag/edit)
       2. Data Scientist @ Trinet \- connect in Austin
       3. Data Scientist @ Klaviyo \- boston-based
12. Operations
    1. Kicked off pre-seed raise, now at 700 in hand / 730 committed / 1.2m target
    2. Timing goal is flexible so we can optimize for value-add angels rather than just pad with a bigger check from a fund who’s gonna be mostly hands off (although we have that option)
    3. Finalizing model for 1.2m raise \- keeping things pretty lean
       1. Targeting 1.5-2 engineering hires in june (potential for contract-to-hire on one), plus 5 hr/week from an operations advisor
       2. Budgeting 15k/month per FTE, Plus another \~8k/month across cloud, tooling, legal, travel, office expenses, etc.
       3. Another engineering hire targeted for August, can pull forward or push back depending on need / how fast we’re growing
       4. Targeting 18 months of runway (if we close zero revenue, closer to 15 months)
    4. Still working with
       1. Wes McKinney, Composed.vc (min 1% allocation \- 80k+)
       2. Invest In Data \- IID, usually smaller 200-300k checks from strategics (e.g. I got a ping from docsend that a data people from US bank, Klayvio, watched one of our videos last week). They would probably need until mid-may to decide.
       3. Boldstart \- partner call on Monday 4/22 \- this is probably the only institutional fund I’d let in for a full 500-750k
       4. A number of other angels on the radar, incl Benn Stancil, Barry McCardel, Jason Ash, still in the mix, have a longer list where I’m digging for intros
       5. New Stack \- they typically target at 10% allocation, but have room for an “off thesis” check in the 200-300k range, fairly hands off
       6. Lightbank \- Can tap into this one as well if we’re interested, would probably be similarly hands-off
       7. Heavybit \- first meeting was great, second was a bit of a whiff, will be interested to see where that goes. My feeling is if they get in, it will be post-close with a discount note for the next round.
    5. Hiring \- chatting w/ some folks that both Ravi and I have worked with before
       1. 3 hour conversation w/ candidate for first design/product hire on wednesday, went very well, would need to figure out some details WRT timing and fractional vs. full-time
       2. Long in-person chat w/ candidate for first full-stack engineer and potential future VPE on thursday, lot of interest there as well
