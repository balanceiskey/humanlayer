#### Founders Essay

Not a ton of product udpates here, we've been heads down on a number of experiments lately, doing some customer discover on a few different directions we could take. At the end of the day, SDKs that wrap slack/email APIs may not be a broad enough solution for what real buyers need. We can get a lot of energy and attention from indie devs, but serious builders weren't responding. At the beginning of last month, the plan was to explore the "turn your MCPs into an email address you can delegate to" angle, but have since decided to focus instead. We're still in early stages, but we think we can build a great product for managing many coding agents in parallel.

This is an incredibly competitive market, and in many ways this direction would be the biggest swing we’ve taken to date. It would position us to compete with Devin, Vibe Kanban, and even Cursor soon. I’m excited to see how much we’ve been firing on all cylinders since deciding to explore this. I'll continue to update y'all with my competitive thesis on the space as it evolves, and why the future of software work needs new tools, new UX paradigms, and a new approach to human/agent collaboration.

Theres a few strong GTM angles we're exploring, from the bottom-up dev-first workflow, as well as more top down like "approach CTOs and ask if they want help making their team more ai-native in development". We've got a waitlist at https://hlyr.dev/code, and since mentioning it offhand to a few founders 2 weeks ago, we have 20+ organic inbound just by word of mouth from people who want to try things out. My 2-week goal is to get 100 waitlist signups and get live hands-on product feedback from at least 20 of them.

What about 12 factor agents? At the risk of losing focus, we are still keeping a finger on the general conversation around agent architecture and how to build great agents. Being an authority on great agents gets us two things

1. General distribution - I can book meetings I couldn't have before, and I get lots more inbound interest than previously - many of the 4k stars on the github repo converted
2. Sales process acceleration - some signals that having a high-quality resource out there makes it much easier for 
3. Broader vision alignment - our big picture vision is to build tools that help agents scale humans, not replace that, which means building great platforms and UIs for a single person to manage 10s or 100s of agents asynchronously. Both the current coding focus and a broader "superhuman for agents" angle.

Fun highlight - the term Context Engineering, (which we wrote about back in april in 12fa) is getting a ton of traction including from Tobi of Shopify, Swyx, Harrison Chase, the folks behind Devin, and others. Short highlight here - https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-06-25-context-eng.

Thanks as always for your support as we traverse this quickly evolving AI landscape - some cooler, more concrete updates coming your way next month. We're still keeping burn low and staying lean, but by no means complacent in the face of less-than-ideal growth numbers.

#### How you can help

We're starting to source eyes for a new prototype we're exploring (see below). On the lookout for CTOs/VPEs who have an initiative to educate/empower/enable their teams to do more AI-assisted coding. Teaser and waitlist signup at https://hlyr.dev/code or feel free to intro me via email.

### End of February Update

Short update \- team growing, velocity picking up, lot more bandwidth toward building prospect pipeline in March.

**Company Numbers**

- MRR: $1500 (+$0)
- Customers: 3 (+0)
- Commercial Prospects: 13 (+1)
- Cash: $2.6m
- Monthly Burn: $50k

**How You Can Help**

Biggest priority is building pipeline \- a new GTM angle that’s landing well (based on success of our friends at mandel.ai from YC S23) is “the Human-in-the-Loop over email goes a long way to getting enterprises to trust AI that does real, impactful, valuable work”.

So my current ICP I’m testing is “Series-A AI company, looking to drive bigger/faster enterprise trust/adoption”.

Exploring the same for working with innovators _inside_ the enterprise that are building “first-party” AI agents.

If you know folks that fit the bill, send ‘em over\!

**Team Updates**

### End of January Update

Howdy \- short one this month, but got a small ask for prospect intros, some fun product updates, and some internal labs projects rolling out.

**Company Numbers**

- MRR: $1500 (+0)
- Customers: 3 (+0)
- Commercial Prospects: 14 (+1)
- Cash: $2.7m
- Monthly Burn: $35k
- Runway: 77 months
- Q1 Goal: 25k MRR

**How You Can Help**

We want to help forward-thinking startups build awesome stuff with AI. These days I’m iterating heavily on reference architectures for AI Agents, because building agentic workflows into existing apps is a pretty tangled mess, and there’s a lot of weird advice out there. If you know teams that are looking to quickly evolve their SaaS product into an AI agent, I’d love an intro.

**Founder’s Essay**

We’re sitting on a good amount of cash but pretty tapped out keeping up with the tech needs of our current customers. Good problems to have but problems nonetheless. As you might imagine, we’re pouring a ton of time into hiring and interviewing founding engineers / eng leaders. I’d say I have talked to 15-20 people, done a ton of second and third round interviews, and have some folks starting on 1099 trials late jan / early feb that I’m super stoked about.

Even with a ton of effort spent there, we also shipped quite a few very cool features in the last month, and since December, stoked to share that we are now powering several customer workloads in production. Among a handful of smaller updates, we delivered

- Custom domain whitelabeling for email operations
- Email customization with jinja templates
- Improvements to webhook format and delivery
- API updates to enable human review for LLM classifier workflows

Looking forward, we’re continuing to evolve our thesis on state-of-the-art in AI Agent Architectures. I’ve soft-published the first version of our linear assistant, one of the AI automations we’re using to help run the company. It’s at [https://github.com/got-agents/agents](https://github.com/got-agents/agents), and essentially it’s a “chief of staff” agent that can receive emails about various tasks and jobs to complete, and turn those into structured API calls. As I keep saying (partial credit to Rajal Patel @ Flex on this one) “we keep trying to get AI to do all these deeply technical things like writing code and analyzing data. But what they’re probably gonna be really great at is summarizing what’s going on, and moving context around the organization.”

We’ll continue to build cool stuff here, and work on evangelize what we’re calling “12 factor agents” \- a new standard for AI application architecture that is framework-agnostic and opens the door to more teams who want to “do agent-y things” without needing to buy into one of the opinionated frameworks. Put another way \- [An Agent is a foldL where the reducer is an LLM call](https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/1876041009630728469)

Between building, hiring, strategy, and kicking off SOC2 this month, outbound go-to-market has taken a bit of a back seat, however, inbound interest has still been strong. With a little bit of follow up, we were able to add a couple solid opptys just this last week. As new team members get ramped up I’m excited to get back into growth mode.

That’s all we got right now \- short one this month. Stay tuned for some big drops in Feb

He moved to SF in September and is looking to meet great folks who could refer a possible additional technical co-founder. I've always appreciated your technical chops and network, so I thought you might be open to meeting him._

**Founder’s Essay**
The headline in my eyes is the EU AI Act, specifically [Article 14](https://www.euaiact.com/article/14) \- which describes what I see as a potential interesting opportunity, testing this week.

_Human oversight shall aim to prevent or minimise the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse_

The last 6 weeks have been a bit of a whirlwind, the main focuses have been:

\- 2 weeks deep on cofounder search \- have a few leads but nothing I want to rush out right now, so that’s more passive at this point
\- 2 weeks focusing heavily on outbound sales \- this got us some conversations but didn’t feel like a great ROI on our time
\- 2 weeks focusing a lot on marketing, see if we can get people to come to us

Just wrapped that last two weeks. Going to review but my instinct is that getting this kind of stuff in front of lots of people and driving inbound is super valuable (see “virtual teammates” below)

Some accomplishments I’m proud of

- Reworked entire billing system to be credits-based and pay-as-you-go
- Launched on YC, got a ton of interesting inbound
- Sponsored the AI Tinkerers Humans-in-the-Loop hackathon, gave a strong demo in front of \~100 practitioners, got in the trenches w/ some really good feedback from a bunch of sophisticated users.
  - The finalists included showcases of some very cool HumanLayer implementations \-

During this time, we ended up firing a customer. We had done a “things that don’t scale” type operation where we built+hosted an agent for him. I had the conversation around “we could continue to maintain this but I need to charge more than $100/mo”. We kinda mutually decided it wasn’t driving enough value, so glad to have that off our plate so we can focus on what is evolving as a much more narrow picture of a short-term ICP:

1. “Virtual Teammates” companies \- most of these tend to have a hacked-up version of human layer for unsticking agents. Unclear if we can get them to switch, but good signal that they need this, and we generally get a “if we knew you guys existed I would have rather used this”
2. Internal AI engineer at large enterprise looking to evangelize and deploy agents internally, mostly for back office / IT automations
3. Could narrow to some subset of 1 and/or 2 that are affected by the EU AI Act \- testing some outbound on that this week.

Some goals:

1. Launch on Product hunt
2. Ship some new email-based agent features and demos
3. Close 1-2 accounts at something like $500/mo

### End of September Update Sep 30, 2024

Hi folks \- Dex here, coming at you live from the new HumanLayer HQ in San Francisco as we get ready to plug in for YC's Fall 24 batch\!

**Company Numbers**

- September Revenue: $98 (+$0)
- Customers: 1 (+0)
- Commercial Prospects: 3 (+0)
- Cash: $1.2m
- Monthly Burn: $22k
- Runway: 4+ years

**How you can help**

Priority \#1 right now is finding a technical cofounder. I know y’all all have stellar networks, here’s a snippet in case it helps.

**Founder’s Essay**

I’m beyond stoked about kicking off YC today, can’t wait to get in the trenches with some of the best founders in the world. This will probably be a shorter update.

On the customer development side, we’ve had \~20 conversations this month, with a few converting to second calls and potential commercial use cases. I’m working on kicking off another round of outbound next week, focusing more on technical leaders, engineers, and CTOs, as opposed to the previous campaign’s focus on AI Product Managers. Looking forward to comparing/contrasting the differences there. Outbound is still primarily focused on companies w/ 50+ employees, to eliminate noise from smaller founder-CTOs who may have an incentive to play with new tools even if there’s no commercial angle.

In that time we’ve uncovered some problems w/ customers for things that _are_ human in the loop, but not quite aligned with the current product direction. For example, I had a call with a team building an Executive Assistant that works over email, and they had a need for a more traditional RLHF with manual labeling \+ regular re-tuning of model weights, for very specific tasks (not agentic/tool-calling). They do this once a quarter because even outside the human labeling, things are quite manual. They’d like to do this weekly, and it sounds like there’s a product gap in the market here (although I haven’t done the research to confirm).

I’m starting to get some light confirmation on another hypothesis that surface in July/August \- once you help someone build a great agent using HumanLayer, the next question is almost always “how/where do I run this”. We’ve experimented with a few options, including fly.io and some other container-based platforms, and haven’t found the right angle. Obviously if someone has AWS+EKS+etc, running yet another container is not a problem, but a lot of folks who want to harness the power of agents don’t have this. So I’m continuing to explore on the side: what might it look like to build a PaaS for agents? Some early prototypes coming together there.

Thanks as always to everyone, old and new, who’s cheering us on\! Here’s to a highly productive next few months 💪

**Product Highlights**

It's been a crazy two weeks moving across the country, but we didn't let that stop us from continuing to build awesome things with our community \- a few highlights:

\- We were live in person at the [AI Tinkerers Hackathon in Seattle](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ulib_and-the-winners-are-incredible-activity-7245054524204204032-soa9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), where 80+ world-class AI engineers joined to build Human-in-the-Loop tools, competing for 14k+ in prizes and credits.
\- New feature, developed in collaboration with one of the hackathon teams \- [Automated Slack Blocks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dexterihorthy_very-stoked-about-this-humanlayer-yc-f24-activity-7245497456577150977-yYwU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
\- New starter guide for [using HumanLayer with Anthropic](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/examples/langchain-anthropic/04-linkedin-anthropic.py#L121-L151)
\- Previously, agent usage of the HumanLayer API was tracked at the Project/Company level. We’ve rebuilt how API token authentication works in the HumanLayer API to give us user-level insights into usage and adoption metrics. With any luck, my next update will have some more fine-grained insights on adoption and overall usage.


### End of August Monthly Update

It’s been a wild month officially pivoting to HumanLayer, launching at AI Tinkerers in San Francisco, and kicking off a ton of customer development. Just dropped our [Latest product update on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dexterihorthy_aiagents-humanintheloop-activity-7235301250165043201-u1BK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), give us a boost if you can\!

Two big announcements \- **closed our first revenue** from a solopreneur who’s using HumanLayer to automate lead generation for his technical content marketing agency, starting at $98 MRR but I believe there’s room to grow here. Second, I think you all know this, but I’m officially **headed out to San Francisco** to build this thing with the world-class AI community there. I’ll be based in SF starting September 24th.

**Company Numbers**

- August Revenue: $98 (+$98)
- Customers: 1 (+1)
- Commercial Prospects: 3 (+3)
- Cash: $570k
- Monthly Burn: $20k
- Runway: 28 months

**Founder’s Essay**

It’s been a wild month, and I’m definitely feeling the pull for the new direction I’ve been exploring. The AI engineering community is vibrant and highly productive these days.

However, I’m still keeping an eye on the fact that most of our users and testers are smaller teams, either CTOs of \<10p startups, or tinkers, or agencies building custom agents.. We’ve yet to vet out this product at the more commercial layer, and have started some dedicated outbound to AI Product Managers at 40+ person companies to try to get a feel for how this fits into the buying equations for larger teams who might feasibly spend spend 10-25k annually.

The more I think about things, the more I am thinking that HumanLayer is probably just chapter 1 of this whole equation. I don’t see this thing selling at the enterprise tier for 6-figure contracts, it probably caps out around 25k or al little above. In light of that, I’m spending all my spare cycles designing out what I think could be a great chapter 2\. This is more in the AI Agent Orchestration space, and solving a lot of the problems that have been overlooked in the most popular tools like LangChain, CrewAI, even more modern approaches like LangGraph. The good news is that if HumanLayer catches on, the workflows it gives folks will call for a next-gen orchestration framework, and I think there’s massive enterprise value in building “the kubernetes of AI”

That said, the interest in chapter 1 is there, the community is excited about HumanLayer. Even as I keep eyes on the longer-term bigger picture, we’ll also keep leaning into that energy and momentum around the core product and continuing to see what the potential is there.

Deeply grateful to you and to everyone else who’s been rooting for us. 1.2k ARR in the bank, here’s to the next 50k\!

### And Now for Something Completely Different \- Mid August Update

###

**HumanLayer Pre-Launch**
_(for people I met post-metalytics)_

Hi\! Stoked to share that we’ll be launching HumanLayer TONIGHT, on Wednesday August 21, at [AI Tinkerers](https://sf.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-san-francisco-august-2024-meetup) in San Francisco.

As a refresher, [HumanLayer](https://humanlayer.dev) is an AI productivity platform which brings human interaction and human approval to asynchronous and outer-loop agents. It’s deeply rooted in the idea that the next generation of AI agents will call for an inversion of control \- rather than humans consulting AI in e.g. a chat workflow, AI will be reaching out to humans as needed for input, feedback, and approvals.

1. Progress
   1. Started interviewing potential users July 22, started building this experiment July 30th
   2. I’ve built an MVP, done 6 demos w/ technical users so far, and have a few enthusiastic design partner candidates lined up
   3. Will be presenting at [AI Tinkerers San Francisco](https://sf.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-san-francisco-august-2024-meetup) on 8/21, and [AI Tinkerers NYC](https://nyc.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-august-meetup) on 8/26, and beyond
2. How you can help
   1. Give us a star on [github](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer), follow on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/104155175/admin/dashboard/) or [X](https://x.com/humanlayer_dev), or join us in [discord](https://discord.gg/KNATT2xK)
   2. We’ll be launching on HackerNews on Wednesday \- if you want to help by giving us an upvote, reply to this email and I’ll send you a note on Wednesday
   3. If you’ve played with agents and tool-calling, and want to give HumanLayer a spin, [grab some time](https://calendar.app.google/3XfZW6A34SbRhkDA6) and I’ll get you onboarded.
   4. If you know AI Engineers or AI Product Managers who are struggling to ship high-quality AI products or scale the “vibe check” in AI, reply to this email and let’s figure out an intro (or feel free to forward this along)
   5. I’m **currently on the lookout for a strong founding engineer** \- if you know great, scrappy engineers who’ve always wanted to do the startup thing \- let’s talk

Thanks especially to our early contractors and advisors, our investors who continue to believe in us, our design partners going deep with us to explore potential product angles, and to everyone out there who’s given us energy in the last nine months \- your intros, advice, brainstorming and general support make a huge difference, and I can’t wait to show you what’s next.

**From Metalytics to HumanLayer**

howdy \- I know at some point we chatted about Metalytics, wanted to update you on the latest direction

We still believe strongly that the data industry needs better tools for understanding the value and impact of data work, but in the short term, we’re exploring a new angle \- **HumanLayer**

[HumanLayer](https://humanlayer.dev) is an AI productivity platform which brings human interaction and human approval to asynchronous and outer-loop agents. It’s deeply rooted in the idea that the next generation of AI agents will call for an inversion of control \- rather than humans consulting AI in e.g. a chat workflow, AI will be reaching out to humans as needed for input, feedback, and approvals.

### June 2024 Update

**Company**
$613k in the bank, $26k/mo burn, 17mo of runway, 7 active prospects, new ones include DBT, GraniteRock, and Mux

**Sales and Marketing**
Had a good showing at the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco, connecting face-to-face with existing prospects and finding a handful of new ones. Hosted a small dinner w/ a few prospects, founders, and other folks from the data community (thanks to Preface Ventures for sponsoring 💪). Had good conversations w/ founders of Dagster and Tobiko data around co-marketing for our recently open-sourced [Open Data Products](https://github.com/open-data-products/odp) tool.

Compared to May, we did far fewer investor/advisor meetings, more prospect meetings, and spent more time on product \- in July, **aiming to hit 20+ customer calls** and **add 5-10 new opps to the pipeline**. By end of July, we hope to have 3 active product evaluations (part of this is waiting on marketplace security review from Snowflake team, which is supposed to take about a month right now).

**Product**
We spent a lot of June gathering feedback and talking to prospects about a few new prototypes, including the [“Data Impact Report” on the website](https://metalytics.dev), as well as some more stripped-down versions of the core Metalytics web app suitable for deployment via the Snowflake marketplace. We have found some strong signal that deploying via the snowflake marketplace will help us to overcome some of the security/activation energy hurdles with larger prospects. Case in point: a large prospect (2000+ employees, \~150m revenue) said they would be excited to do an evaluation if we can deliver our app in this way.

Our product is evolving based on a lot of feedback to be simpler and to enable async/autonomous notification-driven workflows (where users don’t need to log into the tool to get value from it). They connect their systems and then it starts pushing insights to slack, github, and ticketing systems.

Longer term, Metalytics will progress from detection/notification to resolving problems automatically, becoming an autonomous data engineer. We’re starting with simple tasks like deprecating unused workloads, and evolving to more complex tasks like creating and evolving data models in systems like DBT, LookML, and more. A few previews below, with a deeper focus on “just what’s actionable” and some exploration of a more single-stream, chat-focused interface.

We’re excited to get a video demo of this stuff together in the next couple of weeks.

### May Update \- Short

Hi folks \- for most of y’all getting this, you already have most of the details, but here’s the latest \- let me know what I missed

- Biggest update here is that we’re taking a step back to focus on updating our Persona and Promise \- selling more directly to data leaders, and business leaders who own the bill for a centralized data function (CTO, VPE, CEO, CFO) \- prototypes making it onto the website at [https://metalytics.dev](https://metalytics.dev).
  - This is in part due to the fact that our most promising design partner pulled out for the foreseeable future
- Doing some pipeline rebuild to test this new hypothesis / product direction. This week we’re at the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco doing some heavy prospecting (June 3-6)
- Have a very promising potential advisor in [Philip Zelitchenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipzelichenko/) (ZoomInfo). Philip believes strongly in our vision and that in 5-10 years a tool like Metalytics will be core to how every business does data – In [a deep dive with Tom Tunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/managing-data-as-product/), Philip describes a similar tool they built internally at ZoomInfo
- Deprioritizing remainder of fundraise to try to get some more milestones WRT this new product direction. That means we get to hold the remaining 250-450k for serious value-add angels as we build momentum \+ social proof for a proper seed round in \~12 months.
- Starting July 1 we’ll reduce burn from $35k/mo to $26k/mo, keeping us at 20 months of runway
