# Triage SOP

## What
A queue for issues that need team prioritization during [daily standup](./daily-standup.md).

## When to Use
- Unsure where issue belongs (Todo/Backlog/etc)
- Need team input on priority
- Skip if you already know placement

## How
- **Access:** `g` â†’ `t` (go to triage)
- **Create:** `c` (from triage view)

## Schedule
- **Daily:** Review during [standup](./daily-standup.md) at 8:30am PST
- **Async:** Triage obvious items anytime

## Process
1. Review all triage items
2. Decide: Priority, Destination, Owner
3. Move to appropriate location
4. Clear queue daily

## Start
1x daily during [standup](./daily-standup.md). Adjust frequency as needed.
