This is a non-exhaustive list of things to do before/during/after a customer call

- fetch calendar events daily (SKIP - NEEDS TOOLING) and add any

### Before
- add "Background" notes in global/shared/company/crm/{customer}/internal-notes.md under the appropriate ### YYYY-MM-DD header


### During

- take notes in global/shared/company/crm/{customer}/internal-notes.md - with a ### YYYY-MM-DD header
- record call to video or transcript


### After

- use zoom fetch tool (SKIP - NEEDS TOOLING) to fetch call transcript
- Update notes in global/shared/company/crm/{customer}/internal-notes.md
- create shareable version in global/shared/company/crm/{customer}/shared-notes.md
- create email draft, which will be sent to customer as followup in global/shared/company/crm/{customer}/YYYY-MM-DD-email-...md
