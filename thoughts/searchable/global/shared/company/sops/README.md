# Standard Operating Procedures

This directory contains workflows for various tasks.

## Important Note
These SOPs are designed to serve dual purposes:
1. **Human Prompts**: Clear instructions for team members to follow standard processes
2. **AI Prompts**: As we develop tools that enable AI to execute these procedures, these SOPs serve as the prompts/instructions for AI agents to follow

This dual-purpose design ensures consistency between human and AI execution of company processes.
