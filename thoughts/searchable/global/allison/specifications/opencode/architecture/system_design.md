# OpenCode System Architecture

## Overview

OpenCode follows a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers. The system enables AI-assisted coding through a terminal interface while supporting web-based session sharing and collaboration.

## High-Level Architecture

The system architecture consists of five main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces (TUI, Web)
2. **API Layer**: HTTP endpoints and real-time communication
3. **Business Logic Layer**: Core functionality and integrations
4. **Data Layer**: Persistence and state management
5. **External Systems**: AI providers and development tools

## Component Relationships

### Core Components

- **Go TUI Client**: Terminal-based user interface using Bubble Tea framework
- **TypeScript Server**: HTTP API server with AI integration capabilities  
- **Web Interface**: Astro-based documentation and session sharing platform
- **AI Providers**: Multi-provider abstraction for various AI models
- **Tool System**: Extensible framework for file operations and integrations

### Communication Patterns

- **HTTP/REST**: Primary API communication between TUI and server
- **Server-Sent Events**: Real-time streaming for AI responses and updates
- **WebSocket**: Live session sharing and collaboration features
- **Event Bus**: Internal component communication and state synchronization

## Data Flow Architecture

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: TUI connects to server, loads existing sessions
2. **Creation**: New session created with unique ID and storage directory
3. **Messaging**: User input processed through AI providers with tool execution
4. **Persistence**: All conversations and metadata stored as JSON files
5. **Sharing**: Optional public sharing with generated URLs and secrets

### AI Integration Flow

1. **Request Processing**: User message validated and enriched with context
2. **Provider Selection**: Appropriate AI model selected based on configuration
3. **Streaming Response**: AI responses streamed in real-time via SSE
4. **Tool Execution**: AI-requested tools executed with security validation
5. **Result Integration**: Tool outputs fed back to AI for continued conversation

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- **AI Provider Auth**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure credential management
- **Session Isolation**: Each session operates in isolated storage directory
- **Permission System**: User confirmation required for destructive operations
- **Cloud Security**: Secret-based access control for shared sessions

### Security Boundaries

- **File System Access**: Absolute path enforcement with permission prompts
- **Command Execution**: Banned dangerous commands with timeout limits
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation throughout
- **Credential Storage**: Secure file permissions (0600) for sensitive data

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability Patterns

- **File-based Storage**: Simple persistence without database overhead
- **Event-driven Updates**: Efficient state synchronization across components
- **Streaming Processing**: Real-time AI responses without blocking
- **Component Isolation**: Independent scaling of TUI, server, and web components

### Optimization Strategies

- **Message Caching**: SHA256-based caching for rendered messages
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand loading of themes and configurations
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent tool execution and AI requests
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and timeout enforcement

## Deployment Architecture

### Local Development

- **Bun Runtime**: TypeScript server with hot reload capabilities
- **Go Binary**: Compiled TUI client with cross-platform support
- **File Storage**: Local JSON files with git-based project isolation

### Cloud Deployment

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless web interface deployment
- **Static Assets**: CDN-delivered documentation and resources
- **Session Sharing**: Public URLs with secure access controls

## Extension Points

### Plugin Architecture

- **Tool System**: Standardized interface for custom tools and integrations
- **AI Providers**: Pluggable provider system with unified abstractions
- **Theme System**: JSON-based theme customization with inheritance
- **MCP Integration**: Support for Model Context Protocol extensions

### Configuration Management

- **Hierarchical Config**: Global, project, and user-specific settings
- **Schema Validation**: Type-safe configuration with runtime validation
- **Dynamic Updates**: Hot-reload support for configuration changes

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

- **Database Backend**: Optional database support for large-scale deployments
- **Microservices**: Service decomposition for independent scaling
- **Mobile Clients**: React Native or Flutter apps using existing APIs
- **Distributed Sessions**: Cross-device session synchronization

### Technical Debt

- **Error Handling**: Standardization of error patterns across components
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for all major components
- **Monitoring**: Observability and metrics collection infrastructure
- **Documentation**: API documentation generation and maintenance

## Architectural Principles

### Design Patterns

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through typed events
- **Command Pattern**: Tool execution with standardized interfaces
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates via SSE and WebSocket
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable AI providers and themes

### Quality Attributes

- **Reliability**: Graceful error handling with automatic recovery
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom functionality
- **Performance**: Efficient resource usage with streaming capabilities
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth with multiple security layers
- **Usability**: Intuitive interfaces with comprehensive documentation
