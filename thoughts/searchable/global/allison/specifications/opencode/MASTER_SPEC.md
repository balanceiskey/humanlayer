## Overview

OpenCode is a comprehensive AI coding agent built for the terminal with a client-server architecture supporting multiple AI providers. The system enables interactive coding sessions with real-time collaboration, advanced file operations, and web-based session sharing.

### Key Features
- **Multi-language support**: Go TUI client + TypeScript server
- **AI provider agnostic**: Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, and more
- **Advanced tooling**: File operations, git integration, language server protocol
- **Real-time streaming**: Server-sent events for live AI responses
- **Session sharing**: Web interface for collaborative coding sessions
- **Extensible architecture**: Plugin system for custom tools and providers

## Architecture

### System Overview
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Clear separation between TUI client and AI server
- **Event-Driven Design**: Real-time updates via SSE and WebSocket
- **Multi-Provider AI**: Unified abstraction across different AI services
- **File-Based Storage**: Simple JSON persistence without database complexity
- **Cloud Integration**: Cloudflare Workers deployment for session sharing

### Core Components
1. **TUI Client** (`packages/tui/`) - Go-based terminal interface
2. **Agent Server** (`packages/opencode/`) - TypeScript AI integration server
3. **Web Interface** (`packages/web/`) - Astro-based documentation and sharing
4. **Infrastructure** (`infra/`) - SST deployment configuration

### Communication Patterns
- HTTP/REST APIs for primary communication
- Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming
- WebSocket for live collaboration
- Event bus for internal component coordination

- **Features**: Multi-provider AI, tool system, session management
- **Performance**: Streaming responses, parallel processing
- **Documentation**: [Agent Server Specification](components/agent_server_spec.md)

### Web Interface (Astro)
- **Architecture**: Static site generation with dynamic features
- **Features**: Documentation, session sharing, real-time collaboration
- **Performance**: CDN delivery, WebSocket optimization
- **Documentation**: [Web Interface Specification](components/web_interface_spec.md)

## Data Models

Complete data model specifications covering:
- **Session Management**: Conversation lifecycle and sharing
- **Message Structures**: Rich content with tool execution
- **Configuration**: Hierarchical settings with validation
- **Authentication**: OAuth flows and credential management
- **Tool System**: Standardized interfaces and metadata

Documentation: [Data Models Directory](data_models/)

## API Interfaces

### Local Server API (19 endpoints)
- Session management (CRUD operations)
- Message streaming with AI providers
- Configuration and provider management
- File system operations with security

### Cloud Share API (5 endpoints)
- Public session sharing
- WebSocket live collaboration
- Secret-based access control

Documentation: [API Specification](interfaces/api_spec.md)

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Hierarchy
- Global user settings
- Project-specific overrides
- Environment-based values
- Runtime configuration

### Key Features
- JSON Schema validation
- Hot-reload support
- Provider and model configuration
- Theme and keybind customization

Documentation: [Configuration Specification](configuration/config_spec.md)

## Security Architecture

### Security Measures
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for AI providers
- **Authorization**: Permission-based system with user confirmation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation
- **File System Security**: Absolute path enforcement and access controls
- **Command Security**: Banned dangerous commands with timeout limits

### Security Rating: STRONG
The system implements robust security appropriate for an AI coding assistant.

Documentation: [Security Specification](architecture/security_spec.md)

## Testing Strategy

### Current State
- **Frameworks**: Bun Test (TypeScript), Go testing (Go)
- **Coverage**: Limited (4 test files across entire codebase)
- **Focus**: Tool functionality and theme system

### Testing Gaps
- No integration or end-to-end tests
- Missing CI test gates
- No performance or security testing
- Limited mocking strategies

Documentation: [Testing Specification](testing/testing_spec.md)
